- Have been doing bits and pieces on this blog over recent months, but no posts like this; I've been led to realise how niche my interests are on a number of occasions recently, but this blog is still useful to me, as somewhere to put stuff if nothing else
- I finally added an RSS feed
- I did a massive brain dump addressing the [concerns about p values](@/notes/Statistics/statistical-practice-in-field-epidemiology-so-many-problems-so-many-solutions.md); we've now successfully used Bayesian logistic regression in an outbreak investigation
- I now know how to [install SENAITE](@/notes/SENAITE/installing-senaite-laboratory-information-management-system-on-ubuntu.md), do the [initial setup](@/notes/SENAITE/quick-start-with-senaite-laboratory-information-management-system-configuration.md) and securely configure Nginx Proxy Manager for it; I am learning how to set up laboratory data management workflows and export data through the API
- Started adding my [notes on the `data.table` package](@/notes/R/notes-on-the-datatable-package.md)
- I am now working through [my 2024 reading](@/notes/Books/reading.md)
