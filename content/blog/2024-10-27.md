- When I was previously tasked with implementing [DHIS 2](@/notes/DHIS2/_index.md) for surveillance I must have spend hundreds of hours learning about it and playing with it, both in work and in my own time; the last several months I have been going through a similar process with [SENAITE](@/notes/SENAITE/_index.md) the laboratory information management system; I have been documenting things here as I go, such as [installation](@/notes/SENAITE/installation-senaite.md), [modifying functionality](@/notes/SENAITE/modifying-a-senaite-add-on.md), [styling printed reports](@/notes/SENAITE/senaite-customising-laboratory-report-content.md) and the [myriad other steps](@/notes/SENAITE/post-installation-checklist-for-senaite.md) involved in implementation; this week we should be "soft launching" it at the lab we are working with to see what they think and make any further changes required; I am confident we have chosen the best open source option, but there is further work to do around microbiology/AMR reporting, SMS reporting and integration of the data with DHIS 2.
- Related to that LIMS work, I have been familiarising myself with the SENAITE API (WIP) and also working out how to send secure links for patients to download their own lab reports (using [Bitwarden Send](@/notes/Misc/automating-bitwarden-send.md)).
- Not unrelated is the revival of my interest in Python: as well as reading a [massive Python book](@/notes/Books/_index.md) and delving into the innards of SENAITE I've been [playing with various Python apps](@/notes/R/running-python-apps-from-r.md).
- Finally finished a [massive German book](@/notes/Books/_index.md) that's been on the shelves for years, and also started a good [MOOC](@/notes/Misc/moocs.md) on causal inference, to follow on from a [good causal inference book](@/notes/Books/the-book-of-why-by-judea-pearl-and-dana-mackenzie-book-notes.md) I finished.
- I did a bit of work on the blog recently, upgrading it, adding a Creative Commons licence (you can choose your own licence [here](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/)) and automating the process for creating RSS and Atom feeds using [RSS Anything](https://rss.diffbot.com/); also [added buttons](https://wilk-tweaks.tiddlyhost.com/#About:About%20Functional%20Visual) so you can copy code sections. 
- We actually used [Bayesian statistical methods in an outbreak](@/notes/Statistics/notes-on-using-bayesian-statistics-in-outbreak-investigation.md)! and it was easier in several ways than doing it the frequentist way; I've been supporting another research project which is using [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/), though not in a Bayesian way.
- Continuing to monitor interesting developments in the data science tooling space, such as [Vapour](https://vapour.run/), a "better R"; [Positron](https://www.appsilon.com/post/introducing-positron), a "better RStudio" (more [here](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2024/07/08/fun-with-positron/)); [Typst](https://typst.app/), a "better LaTeX"; and [hayagriva](https://github.com/typst/hayagriva), a "better BibTex".
