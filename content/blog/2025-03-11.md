- My main global health focus is still on setting up SENAITE open-source laboratory information system for a provincial lab in Pakistan; I wrote up the [post-installation steps](@/notes/SENAITE/post-installation-checklist-for-senaite.md); partners are engaging well, we are adding more and more metadata, and we are hopefully nearing the stage where it can be used in production; I did a presentation on the work at a conference, which generated some interest; I found and reported a [bug](https://github.com/senaite/senaite.patient/issues/120) in the `senaite.patient` add-on; I was slightly worried that not all of the SENAITE API would work but I haven't had any problems yet, and I've written [some useful R functions](@/notes/SENAITE/convenience-r-functions-for-querying-the-senaite-api.md) to query the API; I treated myself to the [Senaite Starter Package](https://ridingbytes.com/product/senaite-starter/) to help me understand SENAITE internals and add more functionality, though haven't played with it yet; I've also worked out how to [add Urdu subtitles](@/notes/Linux/adding-translated-subtitles-to-video-recordings-of-presentations-using-large-language-models.md) to recordings of my training presentations on SENAITE, though it doesn't work perfectly.  
- I now have a social media presence! on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and have abandoned my RSS feeds for the moment; you can find me as @paulcleary.net; I like it so far - it is like Twitter in the good old days; I made the mistake of following too many people at first and then found [this tip](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueskySocial/comments/1f23h5b/tool_to_unfollow_every_account_i_follow/) for doing a mass unfollow; I somehow have over 1,000 followers but my geekery, occasional inanity and absolute avoidance of political commentary will hopefully have led most of them to "mute" me; at the moment I only follow a restricted number of people, such as people I know or particularly interesting people, and also follow a "list" of interesting but prolific accounts, and a "feed" (constructed in [SkyFeed](https://skyfeed.app/)) based on various keywords
- I have set up my own [home server](@/notes/Selfhosting/notes-on-new-homelab-setup.md) now; I like the Nextcloud All-In-One version; it does use a lot of RAM but it is great for updates and backups (I am now using [BorgBase](https://www.borgbase.com/) as my offsite backup)
- I enjoyed doing some Advent of Code last year, all using R; I only got part way through day 9 before running out of spare time, but think I could get further next time; I have put my solutions [here](@/notes/Misc/advent-of-code-2024-days-1-5.md) and [here](@/notes/Misc/advent-of-code-2024-days-6-9.md).
- I have uploaded [the most useful and used Shiny app I ever did](@/notes/R/deef-a-shiny-app.md).
- I have also been playing with [running Python apps from R](@/notes/R/running-python-apps-from-r.md). 
- Also uploaded the text of an [abortive previous blog](@/notes/Misc/stuff-i-found-from-years-ago-when-i-was-going-down-a-web-developmentprint-css-rabbithole.md).
- I have a few old laptops which were discarded by my wife; I have installed [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv/) on one of them (a very old laptop with no functioning battery, that even refused to start until I changed some BIOS options) and connected it to the TV; it's great! I can now watch my collection of old ripped DVDs and YouTube downloads, and easily transfer video files from my phone or other computers on the local network via Samba
- My home Linux desktop machine, an old Intel NUC running Elementary OS, is dying; I've pulled it apart multiple times over the years to clear out dust; wi-fi and Bluetooth don't work anymore; the system flickers and Firefox frequently crashes; printing and Ethernet networking work variably; I just installed [Pop! OS by System76](https://pop.system76.com/) to see what the fuss is about; it has a great GUI, possibly the best I have seen on Linux, but I do need a new computer and have just ordered a cheap replacement mini PC from alibaba.com (if it is any good I will do a review)
- I now have a passing grade on my course: [Causal Diagrams: Draw Your Assumptions Before Your Conclusions | edX](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH559x+2T2024/home) and I'll finish it soon (might add my notes to the blog) and then might start to learn about ethical hacking from [Hack The Box: The #1 Cybersecurity Performance Center](https://www.hackthebox.com/)
- I have also altered the format to use a new theme that became available; not sure I like it, but it is fine for the moment
