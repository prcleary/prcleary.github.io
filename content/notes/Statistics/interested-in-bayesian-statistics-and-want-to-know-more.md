Some suggested articles below. Not a systematic review but ones that I found useful or might be of general interest. Some start off easy but suddenly get hard - dip in and out of several to see which interest you most.

### Problems with p values, confidence intervals and stepwise methods

- [Scientists rise up against statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9) - a short article outlining some of the issues
- [1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility ](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) - the reproducibility crisis
- [An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.140216) - excellent article by David Colquhoun, who is not a Bayesian but clearly explains the problems with p values - probably the best long article to read, but for a shorter more accessible version see he has done a more accessible version [here](https://aeon.co/essays/it-s-time-for-science-to-abandon-the-term-statistically-significant).
- [Statistical Thinking - My Journey from Frequentist to Bayesian Statistics](https://www.fharrell.com/post/journey) - worth reading if you think frequentist statistics is "objective" and Bayesian statistics is "subjective" 
- [The ASA Statement on p-Values: Context, Process, and Purpose](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108) - if you still want to use p values then do read this to understand best practices.
- [Significance, truth and proof of p values: reminders about common misconceptions regarding null hypothesis significance testing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-013-0437-2) - we all need reminding
- [The P Value and Statistical Significance: Misunderstandings, Explanations, Challenges, and Alternatives - PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6532382/) - interpret your p value as a continuous variable and don't use thresholds
- [Beyond psychology: prevalence of p value and confidence interval misinterpretation across different fields ](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-pacific-rim-psychology/article/beyond-psychology-prevalence-of-p-value-and-confidence-interval-misinterpretation-across-different-fields/D1520CFBFEB2C282E93484057D84B6C6) - it's endemic
- [How Confident are Students in their Misconceptions about Hypothesis Tests?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2009.11889514) - strangely worded title; some students thought that a significant p value was *mathematical proof*
- [Redefine statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0189-z) - a proposal to change the p value threshold
- [HARKing: Hypothesizing After the Results are Known ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4) - why you should publish your analytical protocol to give confidence that your results were not due to data dredging
- [The Extent and Consequences of P-Hacking in Science](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106) - "p hacking", selective reporting and publication bias
- [The fallacy of placing confidence in confidence intervals](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0947-8) - "Frequentist CI theory says nothing at all about the probability that a particular, observed confidence interval contains the true value; it is either 0 (if the interval does not contain the parameter) or 1 (if the interval does contain the true value)."
- [Step away from stepwise](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-018-0143-6) - "standard statistical tests assume a single test of a pre-specified model and are not appropriate when a sequence of steps is used to choose the explanatory variables"
- [Moving to a World Beyond “p < 0.05”](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913) - don't say "statistically significant"
- [Abandon Statistical Significance](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1527253)- "We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm - and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it - as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences."

- [Tidy Data and Geoms for Bayesian Models](http://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes) - the Bayesian tidyverse
- [JASP - A Fresh Way to Do Statistics](https://jasp-stats.org) - easy to use statistical software (based on R) that can do most commonly-used frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods (unfortunately no Bayesian logistic regression yet, though they were apparently working on it and this would be a killer feature)
