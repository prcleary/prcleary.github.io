You can get a weather forecast direct from the command line with e.g. 

```bash
curl wttr.in/Liverpool
```

![Weather in Liverpool](https://wttr.in/Liverpool.png)

It works in GitBash.

You can get all sorts of other information - try the query: 

```
Liverpool?format=Dawn: %D Sunrise: %S Zenith: %z Sunset: %s Dusk: %d
```
