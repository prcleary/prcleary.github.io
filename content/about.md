Paul Cleary's blog, created with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [tabi](https://github.com/welpo/tabi), accessible [here](https://prcleary.github.io)

I'm an epidemiologist working in UK public health and global health.  

I am interested in too many things, including:

- Epidemiology (natürlich)
- Developments in statistics and related areas
- Programming: R, Python, now Rust
- Open-source software, self-hosting, cybersecurity
- Global health informatics
- Languages and literature
- Running and climbing

Most of the content is esoteric technical notes - I use this blog/wiki mainly as a reference for myself. I will occasionally blog on my current interests and activities. 

I used to have a different blog - you can still access it [here](/oldblog.html). I am gradually moving any useful stuff over.
