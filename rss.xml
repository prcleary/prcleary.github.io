     <description><![CDATA[- Busy busy; two foreign trips in a short space of time and other pressing deadlines, so not much blogging recently - but made up for it these last weekends - I now have my own installation of the wonderful [Xerte Online Toolkits](&lt;#Installing Xerte Online Toolkits on Ubuntu 22.04 Linux &gt;) for e-learning, which is [easy to embed](&lt;#Embedding Xerte Online Toolkits e-learning in a Web page - example &gt;) in other Web sites - also worked out [how to tweak XOT behaviour with JQuery](&lt;#Xerte Online Toolkits: hiding the Next button for a specified time &gt;) - Wrote up my experience of [anonymising data with the `sdcMicro` Shiny app](&lt;#k-anonymising data sets with the sdcMicro Shiny app &gt;) - Thought I had found [something faster than `data.table`](&lt;#Is polars faster than data.table? &gt;) for R coding - Have started to learn the tidyverse but [needed to get some "bah humbug" out of my system](&lt;#Adapt or perish: learning the tidyverse&gt;) first - Did an [introductory article on the DHIS 2 Web API](&lt;#The DHIS 2 API - part 1 &gt;) for getting data out of DHIS 2 - Wrote a reflective note on [my approach to productivity](&lt;#Getting Things Done, the todo.txt format and the quest for the perfect productivity system &gt;), then stayed up very late over-engineering [a replacement system](&lt;#Fun with file formats: todo.txt and the iCalendar format &gt;)]]>

     <description><![CDATA[- Updated the blog with [a new theme](&lt;#New Tiddlywiki theme: Captivate Theme&gt;), instead of getting a haircut; I like my new online presence anyway, and no one sees the physical me very much these days - Was pleasantly surprised by how much affection I still have for Python, and how easy the `reticulate` package makes [combining R with Python](&lt;#Combining R and Python in RStudio&gt;) - Newly dumped into the blog: the text of a [field epidemiology toolkit](&lt;#Field Epidemiology Toolkit&gt;) document I wrote most of years ago, just so that is there somewhere (NB: some of it is a bit dated, written at a time when epidemiologists were still a bit sniffy about online questionnaires, and used neolithic tools like EpiData) - A lot of my non-meeting time has been filled with meetings recently so I haven't done any exciting global health informatics things, but I did join a [good webinar on getting data into DHIS 2 by SMS](&lt;#Webinar on RapidPro-DHIS2 integration&gt;) and while doing some routine maintenance on my demo versions [I managed to accidentally send some of my tweaks to the developers](&lt;#In which I accidentally submit a pull request to Ozone HIS&gt;) - Embedded a couple of cool things I like looking at into the blog: [your local weather forecast](&lt;#Command line weather forecast&gt;) and [a literary clock](&lt;#And the time is...&gt;) - all someone else's cool work - Still [playing around with ChatGPT](&lt;#More fun with ChatGPT&gt;) and [all the shiny new AI tools](&lt;#Things you can now do with AI online&gt;) - Am finally realising I might need to learn the tidyverse if I am going to stay involved in teaching R...]]>

     <description><![CDATA[- Yet another holiday (still using up leave carried over from the pandemic) and time to read [more books](#Books). But too soon going back to the *anomie* of the public health world. - Gathered my thoughts on [how to learn R](&lt;#How to learn R (an opinionated view)&gt;). I've recently been accused of "forcing" trainees to learn R. That's just not true - I'd be just as happy if they learned Python. - I collate my public bookmarks on [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:prcleary). The tagging system is currently a mess, which I need to sort out (and yes, [there's an R package for that](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/pinboardr)), but I have done a quick summary of [the sites I tend to bookmark most frequently](&lt;#Most frequently bookmarked&gt;) as a metric of utility. ]]>

     <description><![CDATA[- Finished an excellent book on public health informatics while on holiday in Mumbai and Rajasthan; as an entirely unqualified IT hobbyist it was good to see I have done some things right, but I also learned a lot about successful implementation of informatics projects in low and middle-income countries; my notes and reflections on the book are [here](&lt;#Public Health Informatics by Sahay et al - notes and reflections&gt;). - Now that I am fairly happy with [my Proxmox data centre implementation](&lt;#Next steps with Proxmox&gt;) I have been extensively [evaluating OpenELIS and SENAITE](&lt;#OpenELIS versus SENAITE as LIMS options&gt;) for open source laboratory information management; finding some pain points in both options but I think SENAITE is our best option; currently finding my way around the [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/) electronic health record platform and will post on that in due course. But this is all looking increasingly unlike a one-man job... - Am putting out there my personal [information security checklist](&lt;#Information Security Self-Assessment&gt;) in case useful to others. Most countries are a long way from achieving this.]]>

     <description><![CDATA[* Had some time recently to think about how all the various open source technologies that are spinning in my head might fit together into an integrated whole; building a [[diagram|Open source e-IDSR system architecture diagram]] was very helpful with this and to motivate the conversations that I will need to have; also as my learning has been very much based on experimentation so far I have also [[set up my own data centre|Proxmox: your own data centre]] (sort of) to play with the big boys' toys. * Am trying to put any advice I give on statistical or technical matters straight into the blog; although I was aware of [[Firth's logistic regression|Notes on Firth's logistic regression and model selection]] as a method to try if all else failed, from my recent reading it looks like we should consider it more often. * Some miscellaneous links or notes: [[the latest DHIS 2|DHIS 2 version 3.9 - wow]], a [[really good article on machine learning and deep learning|Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A review for Ecologists (arXiv)]] and some lists of cool tools [[here|Online tools which may occasionally be useful]], [[here|Online diagram editors]] and [[here|Useful websites for checking if your site is secure]].]]>

     <description><![CDATA[* Starting to teach my son Python again - we haven't been good at keeping this up previously (and they seem to do very little at school) but I will keep my notes [[here|Gentle introduction to Python]]. Summarised my thoughts on R/Python bilingualism, as expressed to a colleague, [[here|Should I learn Python now I know R?]]. * Back to doing some coding, this time on TB epidemiology, and collating snippets of R code as I go along, as I usually end up Googling the same things time after time. Creating my own [[R cheatsheet|My R cheatsheet]] for quick things and &lt;&lt;tag snippet&gt;&gt;s for anything a bit more complicated like a useful function. Also creating [[my own cheatsheet for Git|My Git cheatsheet]]. * Lecturing on Bayesian statistics soon - my [[very rough notes|Teaching Bayesian statistics]] are online. ]]>

     <title> 2022-10-29 Windows Subsystem for Linux 2; Observables; additions to the wiki; what I'm reading </title>

     <description><![CDATA[* As someone who used Linux exclusively for years, and now has to use Windows mainly for work, I am interested in any possible "best of both worlds" solution. Windows Subsystem for Linux (now on version 2) allows you to install one of several versions of Linux alongside Windows. I [[previously looked at WS1| Getting Windows Subsystem for Linux to work on Windows laptops]] and was a bit disappointed. I [[played around with WSL2|Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2), RStudio, Git, Docker and a Windows laptop]] this afternoon and it seems to have a lot more potential. It would still be easier to use Linux alone, but WSL2 could be a really useful adjunct for analytical or development work. You can use the Linux command line from RStudio, or run RStudio from Linux. I even managed to get Podman containers working after a bit of experimentation. * Started to [[see what you can do with Observables|First steps with Observables in Quarto]] in Quarto earlier this week - not sure how much use it is going to be for me, and it seemed like a lot of work to get a simple bar chart, but it seems to be very capable in the right hands - see the [[tadpoles|https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/tadpoles]] example (are they really tadpoles?) * In spare moments I have been copying over notes from other places where I have been keeping notes. Most of it is already Markdown and easy to move over, but I also have extensive Vim Outliner notes from a previous period, and also even some Evernote stuff from way back, which I will need to sort out at some point. I am tagging it all &lt;&lt;tag stuff&gt;&gt; for the moment; bits of code are tagged &lt;&lt;tag snippet&gt;&gt;. So this is partly blog, partly wiki and partly [[digital garden|https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up]] at the moment. * See the [[Books]] page for what I'm currently reading. ]]>

     <title> 2022-10-24 Blogging in Tiddlywiki </title>
     <link>https://prcleary.github.io/#2022-10-24%20Blogging%20in%20Tiddlywiki</link>
     <pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 18:59:45 GMT</pubDate>
     <description><![CDATA[[TiddlyWiki](https://groktiddlywiki.com/read/), a single page HTML wiki, has been around for a long time. I have used it a lot over the years, first as a single file saved to my computer/USB drive and later as a (now quite large) self-hosted Docker container running behind [CapRover](https://lowendbox.com/blog/install-200-apps-in-your-vps-with-one-click-introduction-to-caprover/). A TiddlyWiki is a great place to dump anything from random thoughts to checklists to code snippets. You can use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), plain text, HTML or Tiddlywiki's own wiki syntax to create entries like this one (called "tiddlers"). I've just started to get interested in blogging as a way to share niche things that may be of interest to people working in a similar area to me. I have considered or tried out several blogging platforms including [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [Hugo ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKpf3rK57I) and [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/getting-started.html#installLinux), and of course Wordpress, but wanted something a bit quicker to set up and use. Then I came across [this tip on how to use TiddlyWiki as your blog on GitHub](https://pesho-ivanov.github.io/#Two-click%20TiddlyWiki%20with%20GitHub-pages). As I was already familiar with TiddlyWiki, it took me less than an hour to set this up. Couple of notes to future self: - I used [Stroll](https://giffmex.org/stroll/stroll.html) as my empty `index.html` file - this is just a souped-up version of TiddlyWiki. - I used a [classic GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), non-expiring but only with scope `public_repo`. Now I can edit this blog in my browser from anywhere. Tagging is really easy. I don't have to build a whole website to check everything is working. If I keep things simple (i.e. avoid uploading too many attachments or images) this should work well. I still need to work out how to set up an [RSS feed](https://kevincox.ca/2022/05/06/rss-feed-best-practices/) but that can come later. ]]>
