     <description><![CDATA[<p>- Off today so catching up with the blog. - Lots going on as always; at work I am increasingly being led down a technical leadership path, which is not always comfortable for me, and mostly takes me away from doing lovely technical stuff, but it seems to be what they need me to do; the global health work is progressing, but as always taking longer than expected - I am a bit behind with my reading plan, due to work spilling over into life, but I have just updated my [reading log](#Reading); I am travelling abroad soon and hope to catch up then - I have got over my initial enthusiasm for [Bluesky](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://bsky.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://bsky.app/</a>) and now just occasionally browse it or [Mastodon](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://infosec.exchange/explore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://infosec.exchange/explore</a>), usually when I am too brain-dead to even watch television. - I have set up [Karakeep](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://karakeep.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://karakeep.app/</a>) on my home server and really like it; I am back to following lots of RSS feeds and Karakeep hoards any web pages I have visited in a searchable form; the Android app is simple but fine; I have even configured it to use the OpenAI API for automatic tagging - Having realised that the OpenAI API was simple to use, and not that expensive if you carefully choose your LLM, I then set up [icereed/paperless-gpt: Use LLMs and LLM Vision (OCR) to handle paperless-ngx - Document Digitalization powered by AI](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/icereed/paperless-gpt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/icereed/paperless-gpt</a>) to sort out my PDF collection; since I got it working it has worked well - In general, and in part inspired by this article ([Why You Should Be Vibe Coding in Your Home Lab Right Now! - Virtualization Howto](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.virtualizationhowto.com/2025/09/why-you-should-be-vibe-coding-in-your-home-lab-right-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.virtualizationhowto.com/2025/09/why-you-should-be-vibe-coding-in-your-home-lab-right-now/</a>)), I've been resorting to AI chatbots more and more to solve technical issues; I am not sure it saves time, as you often have to iterate several times to get working code, and then carefully check what it has given you, but it can be more fun than frustratedly Googling some obscure issue - I set up [Chocobozzz/PeerTube: ActivityPub-federated video streaming platform using P2P directly in your web browser](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube</a>) as an interim platform for training videos, which I made using [Awesome Screenshot â€“ Screen recorder and Screen capture](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/</a>); it is a little bit slow to load but otherwise has worked well - I am back to using [Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://apps.ankiweb.net/</a>) more - it even helps with guitar practice. - I managed to install [Open Source Home Theater Software | Kodi](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://kodi.tv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://kodi.tv/</a>) on the family TV without breaking anything; now I can watch videos downloaded to my PC (usually free film noir or other classics from YouTube or similar resources - I don't have the bandwidth for anything illegal) from any device that can connect via [Samba - opening windows to a wider world](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.samba.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.samba.org/</a>), including my phone using [Cx File Explorer | AlphaInventor](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.alphainventor.com/cx-file-explorer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.alphainventor.com/cx-file-explorer</a>) - I have upgraded and tidied up the blog but there are still some things I don't like about the current theme and I keep looking for alternatives. - Upgraded [Proxmox - Powerful open-source server solutions](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://proxmox.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://proxmox.com/en/</a>) to the latest version on my home server without major issues and added another terabyte of storage; it is not fully automated but all my backups now go to [BorgBase - Simple and Secure Offsite Backups](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.borgbase.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.borgbase.com/</a>) - I fixed my instance of [Xerte Online Toolkit](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.xerte.org.uk/index.php/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.xerte.org.uk/index.php/en/</a>) so that a colleague can experiment with it for e-learning. - Looking forward to a belated post-pandemic recovery sabbatical next year - only taking three months off, but planning to do lots of climbing and meet up with far-flung friends I haven't seen in a long time. </p>]]>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>- Just a quick post - I'm going to try to blog little and often in future - I've always known it was possible to create rates in [DHIS 2](&lt;#DHIS2&gt;), but it was more work than I expected when I came to do it; I've put my notes [here](&lt;#Incidence rates in DHIS 2&gt;) as there were a couple of things I had to work out in the process; it's not difficult though - The University of Oslo does a lot of good webinars about DHIS 2, so I've been trying to catch up with some of them recently; there was a [particularly good one](&lt;#Implementation considerations: infrastructure \(DHIS 2 Academy\)&gt;) about infrastructure considerations for DHIS 2 - I have found a [good way to back up servers off-site](&lt;#Backing up servers and desktops with borgmatic&gt;) that might be useful for the global health work - I've finally got a new home computer! it is a mini-PC that I bought off alibaba.com and it's actually great - will add my setup notes at some point - Finally, I have been looking into app frameworks recently, as we have a need for an incident tracker of some kind and I am not sure shoehorning into DHIS 2 is the best approach; I had been planning to learn Plone to see if I could come up with anything useful with that, but I've just discovered the Frappe Framework which is also Python-based (based on Flask I think) and might be a better bet and so I'm playing with that: [Frappe: Open Source Software](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://frappe.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://frappe.io/</a>)</p>]]>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>- My main global health focus is still on setting up SENAITE open-source laboratory information system for a provincial lab in Pakistan; I wrote up the [post-installation steps](&lt;#Post-installation checklist for SENAITE&gt;); partners are engaging well, we are adding more and more metadata, and we are hopefully nearing the stage where it can be used in production; I did a presentation on the work at a conference, which generated some interest; I found and reported a [bug](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/senaite/senaite.patient/issues/120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/senaite/senaite.patient/issues/120</a>) in the <code>senaite.patient</code> add-on; I was slightly worried that not all of the SENAITE API would work but I haven't had any problems yet, and I've written [some useful R functions](&lt;#Convenience R functions for querying the SENAITE API&gt;) to query the API; I treated myself to the [Senaite Starter Package](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://ridingbytes.com/product/senaite-starter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://ridingbytes.com/product/senaite-starter/</a>) to help me understand SENAITE internals and add more functionality, though haven't played with it yet; I've also worked out how to [add Urdu subtitles](&lt;#Adding translated subtitles to video recordings of presentations, using large language models&gt;) to recordings of my training presentations on SENAITE, though it doesn't work perfectly. - I now have a social media presence! on [Bluesky](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://bsky.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://bsky.app/</a>) and have abandoned my RSS feeds for the moment; you can find me as @paulcleary.net; I like it so far - it is like Twitter in the good old days; I made the mistake of following too many people at first and then found [this tip](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueskySocial/comments/1f23h5b/tool_to_unfollow_every_account_i_follow/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueskySocial/comments/1f23h5b/tool_to_unfollow_every_account_i_follow/</a>) for doing a mass unfollow; I somehow have over 1,000 followers but my geekery, occasional inanity and absolute avoidance of political commentary will hopefully have led most of them to "mute" me; at the moment I only follow a restricted number of people, such as people I know or particularly interesting people, and also follow a "list" of interesting but prolific accounts, and a "feed" (constructed in [SkyFeed](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://skyfeed.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://skyfeed.app/</a>)) based on various keywords - I have set up my own [home server](&lt;#Notes on new homelab setup&gt;) now; I like the Nextcloud All-In-One version; it does use a lot of RAM but it is great for updates and backups (I am now using [BorgBase](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.borgbase.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.borgbase.com/</a>) as my offsite backup) - I enjoyed doing some Advent of Code last year, all using R; I only got part way through day 9 before running out of spare time, but think I could get further next time; I have put my solutions [here](&lt;#Advent of Code 2024: days 1-5&gt;) and [here](&lt;#Advent of Code 2024: days 6-9&gt;). - I have uploaded [the most useful and used Shiny app I ever did](&lt;#<code>deef</code>: a Shiny app&gt;). - I have also been playing with [running Python apps from R](&lt;#Running Python apps from R&gt;). - Also uploaded the text of an [abortive previous blog](&lt;#Stuff I found from years ago when I was going down a Web development/Print CSS rabbithole&gt;). - I have a few old laptops which were discarded by my wife; I have installed [LibreELEC](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://libreelec.tv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://libreelec.tv/</a>) on one of them (a very old laptop with no functioning battery, that even refused to start until I changed some BIOS options) and connected it to the TV; it's great! I can now watch my collection of old ripped DVDs and YouTube downloads, and easily transfer video files from my phone or other computers on the local network via Samba - My home Linux desktop machine, an old Intel NUC running Elementary OS, is dying; I've pulled it apart multiple times over the years to clear out dust; wi-fi and Bluetooth don't work anymore; the system flickers and Firefox frequently crashes; printing and Ethernet networking work variably; I just installed [Pop!_OS by System76](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://pop.system76.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://pop.system76.com/</a>) to see what the fuss is about; it has a great GUI, possibly the best I have seen on Linux, but I do need a new computer and have just ordered a cheap replacement mini PC from alibaba.com (if it is any good I will do a review) - I now have a passing grade on my course: [Causal Diagrams: Draw Your Assumptions Before Your Conclusions | edX](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH559x+2T2024/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH559x+2T2024/home</a>) and I'll finish it soon (might add my notes to the blog) and then might start to learn about ethical hacking from [Hack The Box: The #1 Cybersecurity Performance Center](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.hackthebox.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.hackthebox.com/</a>) - I have also altered the format to use a new theme that became available; not sure I like it, but it is fine for the moment</p>]]>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>- When I was previously tasked with implementing [DHIS 2](#DHIS2) for surveillance I must have spend hundreds of hours learning about it and playing with it, both in work and in my own time; the last several months I have been going through a similar process with [SENAITE](#SENAITE) the laboratory information management system; I have been documenting things here as I go, such as [installation](#Installation%20%C2%B7%20SENAITE), [modifying functionality](#Modifying%20a%20SENAITE%20add-on), [styling printed reports](#SENAITE%3A%20customising%20laboratory%20report%20content) and the [myriad other steps](#Post-installation%20checklist%20for%20SENAITE) involved in implementation; this week we should be "soft launching" it at the lab we are working with to see what they think and make any further changes required; I am confident we have chosen the best open source option, but there is further work to do around microbiology/AMR reporting, SMS reporting and integration of the data with DHIS 2. - Related to that LIMS work, I have been familiarising myself with the SENAITE API (WIP) and also working out how to send secure links for patients to download their own lab reports (using [Bitwarden Send](#Automating%20Bitwarden%20Send)). - Not unrelated is the revival of my interest in Python: as well as reading a [massive Python book](#Reading) and delving into the innards of SENAITE I've been [playing with various Python apps](#Running%20Python%20apps%20from%20R). - Finally finished a [massive German book](#Reading) that's been on the shelves for years, and also started a good [MOOC](#MOOCs) on causal inference, to follow on from a [good causal inference book](#The%20Book%20of%20Why%20by%20Judea%20Pearl%20and%20Dana%20Mackenzie%3A%20book%20notes) I finished. - I did a bit of work on the blog recently, upgrading it, adding a Creative Commons licence (you can choose your own licence [here](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/</a>)) and automating the process for creating RSS and Atom feeds using [RSS Anything](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://rss.diffbot.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://rss.diffbot.com/</a>); also [added buttons](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://wilk-tweaks.tiddlyhost.com/#About:About%20Functional%20Visual" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://wilk-tweaks.tiddlyhost.com/#About:About%20Functional%20Visual</a>) so you can copy code sections. - We actually used [Bayesian statistical methods in an outbreak](#Notes%20on%20using%20Bayesian%20statistics%20in%20outbreak%20investigation)! and it was easier in several ways than doing it the frequentist way; I've been supporting another research project which is using [JASP](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://jasp-stats.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://jasp-stats.org/</a>), though not in a Bayesian way. - Continuing to monitor interesting developments in the data science tooling space, such as [Vapour](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://vapour.run/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://vapour.run/</a>), a "better R"; [Positron](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.appsilon.com/post/introducing-positron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.appsilon.com/post/introducing-positron</a>), a "better RStudio" (more [here](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2024/07/08/fun-with-positron/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2024/07/08/fun-with-positron/</a>)); [Typst](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://typst.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://typst.app/</a>), a "better LaTeX"; and [hayagriva](<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/typst/hayagriva" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/typst/hayagriva</a>), a "better BibTex".</p>]]>

     <description><![CDATA[<ul><li>Yet another holiday (still using up leave carried over from the pandemic) and time to read <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Reading">more books</a>. But too soon going back to the *anomie* of the public health world.</li><li>Gathered my thoughts on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#How%20to%20learn%20R%20%28an%20opinionated%20view%29">how to learn R</a>. I've recently been accused of "forcing" trainees to learn R. That's just not true - I'd be just as happy if they learned Python. </li><li>I collate my public bookmarks on <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://pinboard.in/u:prcleary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pinboard</a>. The tagging system is currently a mess, which I need to sort out (and yes, <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/RMHogervorst/pinboardr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">there's an R package for that</a>), but I have done a quick summary of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Most%20frequently%20bookmarked">the sites I tend to bookmark most frequently</a> as a metric of utility. </li></ul>]]>

     <description><![CDATA[<ul><li>Finished an excellent book on public health informatics while on holiday in Mumbai and Rajasthan; as an entirely unqualified IT hobbyist it was good to see I have done some things right, but I also learned a lot about successful implementation of informatics projects in low and middle-income countries; my notes and reflections on the book are <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Public%20Health%20Informatics%20by%20Sahay%20et%20al%20-%20notes%20and%20reflections">here</a>.</li><li>Now that I am fairly happy with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Next%20steps%20with%20Proxmox">my Proxmox data centre implementation</a> I have been extensively <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#OpenELIS%20versus%20SENAITE%20as%20LIMS%20options">evaluating OpenELIS and SENAITE</a> for open source laboratory information management; finding some pain points in both options but I think SENAITE is our best option; currently finding my way around the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://openmrs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenMRS</a> electronic health record platform and will post on that in due course.

     <description><![CDATA[<ul><li>As someone who used Linux exclusively for years, and now has to use Windows mainly for work, I am interested in any possible "best of both worlds" solution. Windows Subsystem for Linux (now on version 2) allows you to install one of several versions of Linux alongside Windows. I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#%20Getting%20Windows%20Subsystem%20for%20Linux%20to%20work%20on%20Windows%20laptops">previously looked at WS1</a> and was a bit disappointed. I <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Windows%20Subsystem%20for%20Linux%20%28WSL2%29%2C%20RStudio%2C%20Git%2C%20Docker%20and%20a%20Windows%20laptop">played around with WSL2</a> this afternoon and it seems to have a lot more potential. It would still be easier to use Linux alone, but WSL2 could be a really useful adjunct for analytical or development work. You can use the Linux command line from RStudio, or run RStudio from Linux. I even managed to get Podman containers working after a bit of experimentation. </li><li>Started to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#First%20steps%20with%20Observables%20in%20Quarto">see what you can do with Observables</a> in Quarto earlier this week - not sure how much use it is going to be for me, and it seemed like a lot of work to get a simple bar chart, but it seems to be very capable in the right hands - see the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/tadpoles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tadpoles</a> example (are they really tadpoles?)</li><li>In spare moments I have been copying over notes from other places where I have been keeping notes. Most of it is already Markdown and easy to move over, but I also have extensive Vim Outliner notes from a previous period, and also even some Evernote stuff from way back, which I will need to sort out at some point.

     <title> 2022-10-24 Blogging in Tiddlywiki </title>
     <link>https://prcleary.github.io/#2022-10-24%20Blogging%20in%20Tiddlywiki</link>
     <pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 18:59:45 GMT</pubDate>
     <description><![CDATA[<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://groktiddlywiki.com/read" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TiddlyWiki</a>, a single page HTML wiki, has been around for a long time. I have used it a lot over the years, first as a single file saved to my computer/USB drive and later as a (now quite large) self-hosted Docker container running behind <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://lowendbox.com/blog/install-200-apps-in-your-vps-with-one-click-introduction-to-caprover/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CapRover</a>. A TiddlyWiki is a great place to dump anything from random thoughts to checklists to code snippets. You can use <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, plain text, HTML or Tiddlywiki's own wiki syntax to create entries like this one (called "tiddlers"). </p><p>I've just started to get interested in blogging as a way to share niche things that may be of interest to people working in a similar area to me. I have considered or tried out several blogging platforms including <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://ghost.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ghost</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKpf3rK57I" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hugo</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://getnikola.com/getting-started.html#installLinux" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikola</a>, and of course Wordpress, but wanted something a bit quicker to set up and use. </p><p>Then I came across <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://pesho-ivanov.github.io/#Two-click%20TiddlyWiki%20with%20GitHub-pages" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this tip on how to use TiddlyWiki as your blog on GitHub</a>. As I was already familiar with TiddlyWiki, it took me less than an hour to set this up. </p><p>Couple of notes to future self:</p><ul><li>I used <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://giffmex.org/stroll/stroll.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stroll</a> as my empty <code>index.html</code> file - this is just a souped-up version of TiddlyWiki. </li><li>I used a <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">classic GitHub personal access token</a>, non-expiring but only with scope <code>public_repo</code>. </li></ul><p>Now I can edit this blog in my browser from anywhere. Tagging is really easy. I don't have to build a whole website to check everything is working. If I keep things simple (i.e. avoid uploading too many attachments or images) this should work well. I still need to work out how to set up an <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://kevincox.ca/2022/05/06/rss-feed-best-practices" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> but that can come later. </p>]]>
