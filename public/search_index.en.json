In vain you will add things like /feed.xml to the end of the URL or search the page source.\nThe geekiest solution is to use something like RSS-Bridge, either using the official instance or hosting it yourself. I’ve set this up but never spent enough time trying to understand it, and therefore have never got it to work. It is not exactly automatic and requires some knowledge of CSS selectors and similar things (possibly more than I have) to create a feed.\nThere is an easier solution. You can use something like RSS Anything, a free service which provides an RSS or Atom feed for any public Web page with a list of links (not just blogs). If you find a blog with a feed, simply find the page that lists the blog entries and then give that URL to RSS Anything - it will generate a feed for you automatically, which you can then add to your feed reader.\nToday I realised I could automate that process a bit by creating a bookmarklet (a bookmark button in your browser toolbar which runs a bit of JavaScript).

It is a synthesis of decades of broad experience, with several case studies, and would make an excellent source text for a university module on the subject. Two of the three authors are associated with the DHIS 2 software platform, but in keeping with a key theme of this book that the major challenges are often non-technical, there is relatively little discussion of specific technical solutions such as DHIS 2. In fact this is not a technical informatics book per se, and so would be of value to a broad readership including policy makers, programme managers and academics.\nThe authors begin with a historical perspective on developments in relevant areas such as computer science and health informatics, and end with calls to action to adopt an “expanded public health informatics” framework to meet the many information needs of goals such as universal health coverage in LMIC, where hospital data (focussing on individual patients) would be integrated with public health data (focussing on aggregate indicators) and relevant data from other sources. In the main part of the book they review the many challenges (and the many previous failed attempts) in public health informatics and the learning for future such efforts, often bringing in conceptual frameworks from disciplines such as organisational theory.\nI recognised many of the challenges and frustrations from my own experience and occasionally chuckled at their optimism-with-scepticism attitude:\n\n“Typically, this [the information systems lifecycle] starts from expressing requirements, procuring a service provider to build a system, heightening of expectations of how digitization will solve a multitude of problems, and then a period of implementation, a readjustment of expectations, growing frustration and criticisms and mutual recrimination, leading to abandonment or obsolescence of the system, and its replacement through the next cycle.”\n\nAny work to successfully strengthen information systems in LMIC will need to engage with the complexity of numerous issues including: fragmentation; legacy systems lacking interoperability; a range of internal and external stakeholders with conflicting agendas; lack of resource or skills; the lag between technical and legislative developments; poor leadership and weak governance; procurement restrictions (limiting open source software options); poor data quality (sometimes related to perverse incentives); absent common data standards; lack of information security awareness; and limited analysis and use of existing data.\nThere is no simple or quick or common solution to all of this but principles can be derived from previous experience and the research literature on the approaches that do or do not tend to work.\nCentralised, top-down approaches have a poor record, as do outsourced/vendor-specific solutions or purely technically-focussed approaches.\nCentrally-defined data sets with a punitive approach to poor data quality and limited value of the data to lower level users also don’t generally work well.\nComputerisation of unstandardised health information (such as elements of personal health records) is difficult without a prior process of formalisation.\nWhere modest success has been achieved in a complex environment, it has more often been via a bottom-up, participatory, incrementalist, evolutionary approach (which can take time), or through the introduction of an “attractor for change” (an element such as a common dashboard or common standard that is valued by different stakeholders and incentivises adoption and collaboration rather than imposing a specific solution). Better use of data will drive improvements in data quality more than sanctions will. Open source solutions (DHIS 2 and OpenMRS are mentioned) often work well with an evolutionary, participatory approach, though may sometimes be disadvantaged by government procurement rules; they also require acquisition of specific technical skills (e.g. for maintaining Linux virtual machines in the cloud or a data centre) for full ownership of the system without on-going reliance on external technical expertise.\nI think this book will change and improve my practice. Over my six short years of experience in public health informatics, I had arrived at some of the same conclusions by experience, intuition or accident, but this book provides authoritative confirmation of some aspects of my thinking, while also highlighting neglected areas and opening up my narrow-minded focus on IHR to the wider information needs of LMIC.\nI was converted to open source software a long time ago, which likely strengthened my conviction that we should use DHIS 2, at a time when DHIS 2 was not the leading solution it is now. Advocacy is a delayed-effect process and difficult to attribute. I have lost count of the number of meetings I have had with colleagues from different provinces, sectors or others over the years, advocating an open source, integrated, sustainable, secure approach to an often sceptical audience and seeming to get nowhere. But just when you think you have achieved nothing despite saying the same things dozens of times, you start to hear similar messages emanating from partners, or hear of positive developments in line with your urgings. You don’t know if it is because of you, but it is still a good feeling. I also think that to some extent, our implementation of DHIS 2 became an “attractor for change” as people started to see everything that it provided “out of the box”, and compared it to their own in-house/bespoke solutions where they existed.\nI was very narrowly focussed on the technical aspects initially (with the excuse that I was the main person required to do them) but I have increasingly recognised the need for involving and giving value to all levels of the system, and the need for communities of practice and conversations about data. We need to do a lot more to demonstrate the value of the data to all participants, particularly at the lower levels.\nI was sometimes frustrated by the slow pace of change (with occasional setbacks) and the defensive attitude of vested interests, and often feared that my gradualist approach (dictated by limited resource) was not the “proper” way to do things. This book has given me the encouragement that in the complex environment where I work, a grand strategic top-down centrally-imposed implementation would not necessarily have worked, and what I saw as frustrations were actually a necessary process of negotiation.\nThe book also has some interesting thinking on data governance and policy, and how this relates to use of the cloud - I couldn’t initially understand why we couldn’t use cheap commercial cloud services, but I now understand that even there is no explicit prohibition there may be strongly held implicit views on data ownership related to storage location.\nThe book does address information security in a number of places but I think this is a very important area which could benefit from expansion to a separate chapter in a later edition.\nThe authors also recommend greater use of research methods to inform projects and share learning; I do have pangs of guilt that despite much experience we have not yet added anything of note to the research literature. I feel more motivated to add things to this blog than to write papers.\nThis is a well-presented and structured book. There are a number of typoes and the occasional non-native English construction, but in general it is an easyish read after the early more theoretical chapters. I only noted one technical error; there seems to be some confusion between SSH and SSDs on page 108.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Books/public-health-informatics-by-sahay-et-al-notes-and-reflections/","path":"/notes/Books/public-health-informatics-by-sahay-et-al-notes-and-reflections/","title":"Public Health Informatics by Sahay et al - notes and reflections"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Books/reading/":{"body":"Reading\n\n\nStatistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath: reading it as a gentle introduction to Bayesian methods; it is great and I would recommend it to anyone with some statistical background; readable and often funny! it tackles some quite complex areas in a way that is very accessible to those of us who are more comfortable with code than equations; I’ve read that some people get a bit lost from chapter 9 but I’m on chapter 12 and it’s still going well\n\n\nDer Tod in Venedig by Thomas Mann (in German): he’s arrived in Venice but I put this down to read Pickwick Papers and need to get back to it\n\n\nNeuromancer by William Gibson; reading it on personal recommendation; it is also apparently where the concepts of cyberspace and virtual reality were first developed; read most of it but then put it down and might need to start it again\n\n\nProfessional Plone 4 Development by Martin Aspeli; skimming this on and off to get a better understanding of Plone, the complex content management system that SENAITE is built on; very out-of-date and too much on insane Python package management; not sure I will finish it\n\n\nLast read (reverse chronological order)\n\n2025\n\n\nTo The Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf: recommended by my daughter; read it fairly quickly; starts as a detailed psychological account of a seaside holiday gathering of family and arty friends, then (no spoilers) something unexpected happens and you are jolted into a transformed and heightened appreciation of the novel; hard to convey the effect; very good and I will read more by her\n\n\nDead Souls by Nikolai Gogol: must have picked it from a list of classics somewhere; it’s a novel set in provincial 19th century Russia, just after the French  invasion, as is mentioned several times; a well-dressed but mysterious man arrives in a provincial town and charms local society; most of the rest of the novel is him visiting a series of landowners trying to buy the titles to dead serfs; it turns out eventually that he (Chichikov) is a corrupt ex-civil servant with a scheme to get rich by somehow mortgaging dead serfs he has bought cheap (dead serfs still appear on the census and are taxable, so he thinks people will be glad to sell them); it is a penetrating black comedy about corrupt officialdom and the decadent serf-owning classes, but rich in realistic detail; it is actually quite funny in places, particularly where the character Nozdryov is involved (who reminded me a bit of Withnail and probably deserved his own book); some later parts of the book were lost or destroyed, so there are some weird jumps in the story around the time Chichikov is getting his come-uppance at the end; although the modern reader might have some qualms about serfdom (and the apparently high serf mortality rate), it is still quite an enjoyable book\n\n\nThe Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens: serialised comic novel by Dickens which is basically a series of long comic anecdotes, often at the expense of the central character, but develops into something with a bit more heart by the end; read it for self-edification and was surprised to enjoy the merciless, sardonic take on contemporary society and its underlying kindness\n\n\nBlood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy: historically-inspired tale of American bandits murdering their way across Mexico in the days of American expansionism to present an alternative frontier mythology; some Faulknerian vocabulary, portentous descriptions of changing landscape and weather, the character of the superhuman and mysterious “judge” and needless to say much senseless violence and cruelty create a compelling read, but I wasn’t sure it was more than the sum of its parts (or perhaps I haven’t yet tuned in to this author)\n\n\nStructure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson et al (JavaScript version): read it as part of my computer science self-education; I probably learnt the most useful stuff in the early chapters of this book, which expanded on various programming concepts I had acquired from elsewhere and partly appreciated; I will be a lot more comfortable with recursion in future, as it is used liberally here; shows how complex systems can be built with several layers of abstraction, starting from the primitive features of the underlying language; addresses object-oriented and functional paradigms, though not as much as I had expected; I did skim through some of the later parts where there are whole pages of code and lots of detail specific to the particular implementation; I am now very comfortable reading JavaScript code, though perhaps would have preferred a Python version; I can see why it is a classic\n\n\nWaiting for the Barbarians by JM Coetzee: read it because I have really liked some of his other books; it is an allegory of imperialism and complicity with imperialism; readable and of course well-written but quite dry\n\n\nGods of Management by Charles Handy: recommended by a colleague and I’ve recommended it to other colleagues; compares and contrasts different organisational cultures, each labelled with its own Greek god metaphor; very readable; gives you a useful framework to think about your organisation (I think I’m an Athenian in an Apollonian organisation, i.e. a techy problem-solver in a role-based organisation) and seems incredibly far-sighted (e.g. seems to foretell hybrid working) for a book written decades ago\n\n\nWalden by Henry Thoreau: I’ve been meaning to read this for a very long time, as the young me (unencumbered by things like family responsibilities or the need for inhalers) fetishised the ideal of the simple, austere, self-reliant life in “Nature” and spent many school-age hours wandering the fields, woods, shores and disused railway lines of lowland Cumbria on my own; I felt I had an almost physical connection to something then, that I may have lost, but some of that austerity is still there underneath; so I totally got Walden, this classic account of a man living in a self-built hut in the woods near his town to experiment with his ideals; it is sometimes philosophical, sometimes more scientific or practical; I think it was the heartfelt descriptions of the natural environment in the later parts of the book that particularly elevated it for me\n\n\nBeloved by Toni Morrison: recommended by my wife and by my daughter, though with a warning that it was grim; beautiful and poetically written account of the experience of slavery, escape from slavery and the actions occasioned by desperate love; I think I was too in love with the language to find it as emotionally draining as my family did\n\n\nScotland: A Short History by Christopher Harvie: I think I was looking for a potted history; this is more thematic than chronological and perhaps assumes more pre-existing knowledge than I had; covers the many contributions of the people of Scotland but skips over some bits where I would like to have heard the story; well-written and a good read but I still have lots of gaps\n\n\nSymposium and the Death of Socrates by Plato: starts with a drunken dinner party of Athenian greats debating love (oodles of homoeroticism) and the next part is about the condemnation and dignified death of Socrates; I came away still unsure about what Socrates’ philosophy was apart from sarcastically cross-examining and taking apart other people’s arguments\n\n\nThe Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett: read it out of curiosity about its popularity and I’m still curious; it is funny and there is some essential kindness to relate to but I am still wondering if I am too old for it\n\n\nHenry IV, Part Two by\tWilliam Shakespeare: read Part One for O Level English in 1984 so this was unfinished business; read it plain in a non-academic version without footnotes (and enjoyed it more that way); I expected the transformation of Hal into a king and the renunciation of Falstaff, so I think what most struck me was the power politics and the nobility of the rebels\n\n\nIf on a Winter’s Night a Traveller by\tItalo Calvino: postmodern, metafictional, literary experiment, a novel about writing and reading novels, playing with the ideas that, all literature being recursively derivative, the sense of the novel is created or constructed by the reader more than by the author (“la mort de l’auteur” notion of Roland Barthes); disjointed structure made up of the beginnings of several novels, with disorienting passages about various readers and authors; kind of fun in a nerdy way, at least at first, guessing what popular genre is currently being pastiched (bit like watching Community), but the changes in perspective, where anything that seemed true in the world of the novel is again and again proved illusory or false, become repetitive to the point that you wonder if he is even parodying postmodernism itself\n\n\nAdam Bede by George Eliot: read it because I had enjoyed her other novels; found it harder to get into than the others, possibly because I’ve been a bit tired and unwell with a prolonged ear infection, and possibly because most of the action takes place in the final third of the novel; the first two-thirds is nostalgic world-building in an imagined rural Midlands community of previous generations; there was definitely the same nuanced and wry narrator’s voice that is perhaps more developed in later novels, but the characters and the story didn’t quite hang together for me until the novel started to read itself for me in the final tragic sections\n\n\nUpanishads by Unknown: possibly the oldest extant collated work of Hindu (or any) philosophy/cosmology, asking the question “what is reality?” and responding with the intuition that there is a higher, infinite, eternal reality, that is one with the self, from which all things arise, and which is cryptic and imperceptible to most, but which can be reached through sacred knowledge, penance/austerity/self-renunciation, meditation/yoga, sacrifices and ritual, leading to bliss, freedom from care and escape from the cycle of reincarnation; interesting for differences from other religions - the highest level is beyond gods, beyond good and evil; also as an example of the religious experience, which I (though a “non-religionist” according to my Pakistan visa) find fascinating; something about the renunciation of worldly passions or ambitions made me sense the fellowship of 50-something blokes from thousands of years ago\n\n\nAnother Country by James Baldwin: set in 1940s New York, describing with brutal honesty the complex and often painful relationships, romantic or other, of the main black and white characters; hard to summarise so many themes of racism and sexuality in a bullet point, but undoubtedly deep, and I found the writing very powerful and affecting; it felt a bit more like an important novel than a great novel, but wow he was a great writer\n\n\nLes Marana by Honore de Balzac (in French): set during French invasion of Spain in 1811; a career courtesan from a dynasty of courtesans (the Marana) tries to improve her daughter Juana’s life chances by lodging her with an old couple; unfortunately Juana is seduced by a French officer (Montefiore) and has to enter a marriage of convenience with another soldier (Diard), who she does not love; Diard is unsuccessful in business and, meeting Montefiore by chance much later, kills and robs him; Juana then kills Diard but gets away with it; I feel like I am going through the less good stuff from Balzac at the moment\n\n\nL’auberge rouge by Honore de Balzac (in French): set during the post-revolutionary French occupation of part of Germany, told in flashback; a dinner guest relates the tale of a French doctor executed injustly for murder, but gor blimey! the real perpetrator is at the dinner; the narrator is however more interested in his cute daughter\n\n\nLe requisitionnaire by Honore de Balzac (in French): forgettable tale of a mother waiting in vain for her royalist son to come home after a failed counter-revolution\n\n\nLa vendetta by Honore de Balzac (in French): two cute young people fall in love, but gor blimey! there is a Corsican feud between their families; does not end well\n\n\nUn episode sous la terreur by Honore de Balzac (in French): reading as part of my lifetime plan to get through the oeuvre; instantly forgettable novella about a priest, in hiding during the French Revolution, who is asked to perform mass for a mystery royal visitor\n\n\n\n    TypeTitleAuthorPages to readDays to read% per day if ebookCumulative daysDate finished\nFrench LanguageUn episode sous la terreurHonore de Balzac201100102/01/2025\nFrench   LanguageLa vendettaHonore de Balzac106519607/01/2025\nFrench LanguageLe   requisitionnaireHonore   de Balzac25180808/01/2025\nFrench   LanguageL’auberge rougeHonore de Balzac422481010/01/2025\nFrench LanguageLes   MaranaHonore   de Balzac482421213/01/2025\nWorld   LiteratureUpanishadsUnknown2361282424/01/2025\nWorld LiteratureAnother   CountryJames   Baldwin4252154515/02/2025\nEnglish   LiteratureAdam BedeGeorge Eliot6253137618/03/2025\nPlayHenry   IV, Part TwoWilliam   Shakespeare3201669203/04/2025\nWorld   LiteratureIf on a Winter’s Night a   TravellerItalo Calvino26013810516/04/2025\nEnglish LiteratureThe   Colour of MagicTerry   Pratchett56828413414/05/2025\nWorld   LiteratureSymposium and the Death of   SocratesPlato210111014425/05/2025\nHistoryScotland:   A Short HistoryChristopher   Harvie24412815606/06/2025\nWorld   LiteratureBelovedToni Morrison32416617322/06/2025\nWorld LiteratureWaldenHenry   Thoreau33317618909/07/2025\nTechnicalGods of ManagementCharles Handy26213820222/07/2025\nWorld LiteratureWaiting   for the BarbariansJM   Coetzee17091221130/07/2025\nTechnicalStructure and Interpretation of   Computer ProgramsHarold Abelson56428423928/08/2025\nGerman LanguageDer   Tod in VenedigThomas   Mann24812825209/09/2025\nWorld   LiteratureLysistrataAristophanes8942225613/09/2025\nTechnicalStatistical   RethinkingRichard   McElreath48724428008/10/2025\nEnglish   LiteratureTo The LighthouseVirginia Woolf209101029118/10/2025\nWorld LiteratureBlood   MeridianCormac   McCarthy35218630805/11/2025\nEnglish   LiteratureThe Pickwick PapersCharles Dickens80140234815/12/2025\nWorld LiteratureDead SoulsNikolai Gogol35418636602/01/2026\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nSacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth: recommendation from a friend; historical novel of a slave ship from Liverpool in the triangular trade; well done, occasionally reminiscent of Joseph Conrad, and probably a historically accurate account of the slave trade of the times, with its pursuit of profit and casual cruelty, but for me it lacked something in human or literary terms that would make it a great novel\n\n\nA Stroke of the Pen by Terry Pratchett: a very nice present; I’ve always been curious about his popularity, though never read any - I’ve never been sure they weren’t the sort of thing I would have enjoyed best as a teenager; this is an enjoyably quirky collection of early published short stories that had been thought lost; I’m still not sure but I am planning to read one of his novels next year\n\n\nLes Chouans by Honore de Balzac (in French): post-revolutionary France and some of the western regions have risen in revolt against the new republic; a quick, enjoyable read (had to look up a few antiquated terms and some military slang); even if you think the impossible love story part is a bit nuts there is plenty to enjoy in the tense insurgent atmosphere, the descriptions of various bloody skirmishes/massacres and the realistic historical and geographical setting; quite a promising young author I would say\n\n\nBeowulf by Anon (Seamus Heaney translation): Anglo-Saxon poem that inspired Tolkien (and all imitators) and which my daughter read recently; a paean to selfless heroism and acceptance of fate, and a glimpse into a long-ago world\n\n\nTidyverse Skills for Data Science in R by Roger Peng et al: read this in fits and starts to try to address avoidance issues with the tidyverse; very basic and I ended up skimming it; probably should have read Advanced R\n\n\nInside Indian Indenture by Ashwin Desai: family recommendation; academic take on the movement of workers from India to South Africa (Mauritius is  often mentioned too) in the 19th century; outlines the many abuses but also the individual stories of adaptation, resistance or success as far as the documentary record allows\n\n\nBildung (Alles, was man wissen muß) by Dietrich Schwanitz: opinionated treasury of (largely) European history, literature, intellectual thought and general knowledge in German; over 600 pages long; I have been reading this slowly for years and restarted it more than once; the initial history sections are great but I gave up twice previously in the literature and art history sections, where the language got more difficult for me; Schwanitz argues that this common cultural knowledge and the associated ways of thinking (Bildung) are important for society and for individuals, and are perhaps neglected due to things like scientific/technical education, TV and other popular media, and the various “isms” (I am guessing the author has conservative views); he has great admiration for the British and American democratic traditions and a mixed view on Germany, which produced great minds like Goethe but didn’t develop similar early traditions; my German reading ability has taken a step up but I will definitely pick a shorter German book next year\n\n\nPost Office by Charles Bukowski: another breakthrough novel; I read several Phillipe Djian (he wrote the book they made into Betty Blue) novels in my twenties and loved them; Djian occasionally refers to the American authors who influenced him, among whom was Bukowski; it’s a social-realism, semi-autobiographical account of a drunken low-life womanising postal worker who’s just about getting by; read it in a day or so as it’s short and simply written; it does capture something compelling about ordinary American lives of the era\n\n\nLess Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis: since picking up one of his books in a shop years ago and being traumatised by the little I read, I have avoided this author but I do like to read an author’s breakthrough novel so I thought this one might be OK; it is mainly an immersive account of the brain-dead lives of rich American college kids during a holiday; you slowly get numbed to the perversity and excess, as are the characters - but then he hits you with something so despairingly horrible and awful that it can stop you getting to sleep that night; brilliant in its sick way I suppose\n\n\nThe Secret History by Donna Tartt: been wanting to read this for ages, read it a couple of months ago and don’t recall enough to summarise it now; it was well done, but for some reason I kept comparing it unfavourably with AS Byatt’s Possession which was much better\n\n\nThe Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky: I initially connected with the innocent benevolence and ethical goodness of the principal Myshkin character, derided as an idiot when he returns to Russian society after a long convalescence abroad, and that kept me reading even though the other characters were less interesting and the story drags on a bit; Crime and Punishment was much better\n\n\nTwelfth Night by William Shakespeare (Arden version): trying to remedy my lack of knowledge about Shakespeare; it’s slightly weird reading a play, and I should probably see it (I have found a version on YouTube) for a fair assessment, but it was a bit like reading Shakespeare at school again: some of the language is very poetic and quotable but a lot of it is obscure or difficult to understand without frequent recourse to the footnotes, the story wasn’t that interesting and it wasn’t the funniest comedy I’ve come across; I suspect I should read it more like poetry to get the full value\n\n\nFluent Python by Luciano Ramalho: although I used Python in preference to R for a few years, it was mainly for data analysis, and mostly using the pandas package, so I only have a part-understanding of more advanced Python programming topics; I saw this book recommended in several places as an excellent bridge into more advanced topics, and as I am now likely to be using Python for more general-purpose programming, it seemed like a good time to read it; and it’s great! I actually looked forward to my 20 pages each day; it dips into a lot of more advanced areas with amazingly clear explanations, as well as lots of worked examples and pointers to more in-depth reading; I will probably need to read the later chapters again\n\n\nTrieste and the Meaning of Nowhere by\tJan Morris: read it because I hadn’t read anything by Jan Morris, and am also interested in Trieste; personal and admiring account of the history, human geography, architecture, culture and personalities of this unique and fascinating city, former cosmopolitan port of the Habsburg empire, meeting point of Western and Eastern Europe and home of literary exiles (hence “nowhere”); lovely writing\n\n\nThe Book of Why by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie: accessible book on developments in causal inference; read it because it wanted to be aware of any implications for epidemiological data analysis; very engaging and readable; richly illustrated with examples and diagrams; I probably would need to read it again (especially chapters 8 and 9) to be sure I understood everything; my notes are here\n\n\nThe Great Hunger by Cecil Woodham-Smith: written in the early 60s; densely researched and readable history of the period around the wholesale failures of the potato harvests in Ireland (focussing on 1845 and a few years afterwards), due to potato blight, resulting in deadly famine, disease epidemics, evictions, emigration and longstanding bitterness; depicts the dramatic effects on a growing and impoverished rural population living in squalid conditions, often under an absentee landlord; for most, life depended on a potato diet, with other crops sold to pay rent; the early British government response was inadequate to the point of cruelty, shackled by laissez-faire ideology, and the later response almost absent because of economic crisis, prejudice and annoyance at Irish rebelliousness;  assassinations of landlords and half-hearted, disorganized uprisings led the British government to increase troop numbers in Ireland;  emigration, often to Canada then the US, sometimes on deadly “coffin ships”, barely improved the prospects for many migrants; grim reading; did finally make me start researching my Irish antecedents (which was much easier than I thought)\n\n\nWhite Teeth by Zadie Smith: read it on a personal recommendation; was expecting to classify this in light London-based fiction (like Capital) but it is more than that; it’s a bit like Dickens and a bit like Infinite Jest, describing the multicultural London of recent history with humour and detailed, overlapping stories\n\n\nThe Nine Lives of Pakistan by Declan Walsh: bought it because it was there when I was spending my Xmas book token present and because of my interest in the country (I have previously read Pakistan: A hard country by Anatol Lieven and The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience by Christophe Jaffrelot - I remember a quote from one of them about Pakistan: something like “… a conservative country assailed on one side by Westernisation and on the other by radical Islam”); this one covers more recent events than the other books; written by a journalist based in Pakistan for years; it starts with him being expelled as persona non grata and then very readably compresses the history of Pakistan and its many complexities around his accounts of interviews with several major political personalities; at some point, reading any book on Pakistan, your head will start to hurt, but this one is a relatively painless introduction to this fascinating country\n\n\nUnruly by David Mitchell: a very nice present; an account of the kings (and occasionally queens) of England; interesting, funny (his usual comic shtick); learnt a few things despite an inherent lack of interest in royalty\n\n\nMiddlemarch by George Eliot: read it because I had enjoyed The Mill On The Floss and Silas Marner; why did I wait so long to read this book? all books should be like this; tells the stories of the inhabitants of a provincial town in the 19th century with sophisticated understanding and omniscient, knowing irony; the author seems able to step outside her era for a better viewpoint; the writing is superb, amusing and an absolute delight to read; I laughed and I cried; Adam Bede is going on next year’s list for sure\n\n\n\n    YearTypeTitleAuthorPages to readDays to read% per day if ebookCumulative daysDate finished\n2024English LiteratureMiddlemarchGeorge Eliot10085025020/02/2024\n2024English   LiteratureWhite   TeethZadie   Smith4622347414/03/2024\n2024HistoryThe Great HungerCecil Woodham-Smith4102159404/04/2024\n2024PlayTwelfth NightWilliam Shakespeare27214710817/04/2024\n2024TechnicalFluent PythonLuciano Ramalho79040314727/05/2024\n2024World LiteratureThe IdiotFyodor Dostoevsky66733318029/06/2024\n2024English LiteratureTrieste and the Meaning of   NowhereJan Morris18891119008/07/2024\n2024StatisticsThe Book of WhyJudaea Pearl37019520827/07/2024\n2024English LiteratureBeowulfUnknown24512822108/08/2024\n2024TechnicalTidyverse   Skills for Data Science in RCarrie   Wright78039326016/09/2024\n2024English LiteratureThe Secret HistoryDonna Tartt55928428814/10/2024\n2024FactualInside   Indian IndentureAshwin   Desai43822530905/11/2024\n2024French LanguageLes ChouansHonore de Balzac40720533025/11/2024\n2024German   LanguageBildungDietrich   Schwanitz69735336530/12/2024\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nChildren of Men by PD James: read it because of an interesting review somewhere (possibly of the film actually); dystopia centred on Oxford in an alternative timeline where the human race is dying out through (male) infertility; there’s a politely British rebellion against the dictator in power but not much else happens; will check out the film\n\n\nLe Père Goriot by Honore de Balzac (in French): read it because I enjoyed Le Colonel Chabert and because this is the first book in a famous roman-fleuve that could keep me going for decades; centred on the surpassing (but somehow vulgar) love and self-sacrifice of a father for his two daughters; he used his entire self-made fortune to marry them well into high society, while himself living and (spoiler alert) ultimately dying nearly alone in poverty; introduces some other characters who will apparently reappear, perhaps many times, such as Rastignac the social climbing law student, Bianchon the medical student, Vautrin the charismatic gay criminal and Goriot’s high-maintenance daughters; fairly bleak about contemporary morality, social conditions and human decency; surprisingly light and readable\n\n\nDas Buch von San Michele by Axel Munthe: read it because my parents bought it for me when they were on holiday somewhere; it is an interesting (seemingly autobiographical, though likely embellished) account in German of the life of a well-connected Swedish doctor who after a turbulent childhood spent in Sweden trained as a doctor in Paris, worked with Pasteur (seeing cases of rabies), became a society doctor in Paris where he saw poverty, syphilis and diphtheria outbreaks, fought a duel, fell out with Charcot, got some dead bodies mixed up, went mountaineering and got avalanched, met various celebrities (Guy de Maupassant does not come out well), bought and restored a property with lots of Roman archaeological artefacts on Capri, lived there with a menagerie of animals including a monkey, worked as a doctor in Rome, witnessed the cholera outbreak in Naples, visited Lapland where he nearly died, witnessed the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Messina (Sicily); really interesting, sometimes whimsical, a bit more serious at the end; he had some unorthodox views for the time, was kind to children and the poor, not religious, not particularly flattering about doctors (except himself), well-off but not particularly driven by money, and he had an amazing life\n\n\nThe Leadership Secrets of Genghis Khan by John Man: had to read it with a title like that; reiterates the life story of Genghis Khan, slightly less sympathetically than the other book; evaluates his achievements in light of modern leadership theory; the potted version is:\n\ncontrol the narrative; influence others\nshow emotional intelligence\nhave an inspiring vision\nhave integrity\ndedication and sacrifice for the cause\nknow your own limitations and hire smart people\nreward loyalty\nset rules which are clear, fair and universal\nbase your military strategy on clear intelligence and adaptability not wishful thinking or stock solutions\nin peace train for war\nbe a role model and a symbol\nplan your succession; develop others\nuse brutality and surprise when required to create terror\nbe intellectually curious\n“blend humility with intense professional will”\n\n\n\nA Brief History of Seven Killings by Marlon James; read it after my wife recommended it after seeing the author speak at a literary festival; set mostly in Jamaica, with each of several characters taking turns to recount events around the attempted assassination of Bob Marley (who is never directly named); enjoyed it and learned more about that period of Jamaican history; grimly violent in parts\n\n\nGenghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford: impulse purchase at Book Cycle Exeter; OK he killed millions, but it was just business, and he had some progressive ideas for that time, such as freedom of religion; very readable book (glossing over issues such as lack/veracity of sources, in favour of  readability) about a period of history I didn’t know much about; I hadn’t realised the huge extent of the Mongols’ conquests and contacts with the Christian, Muslim and Chinese worlds; his reputation was always a bit exaggerated (it was good propaganda) but has been rehabilitated to some extent as a great figure of history\n\n\nComputer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by James Kurose: read it because I am teaching myself computer science/cybersecurity; took me two or three restarts before I managed to finish it (I’ve been reading this on and off for a few years, and when a new version came out I bought that and started again), but (if you are highly motivated to learn and don’t mind reading a textbook) it is very accessible; it doesn’t assume much prior knowledge about computers, though you have to be comfortable with simple mathematical notation, binary and hexadecimal numbers and simple Python code or pseudocode; has a big focus on the functioning of the Internet; explains its layered structure of services (each with protocols and algorithms), starting at the top with the applications that run on the Internet, and then progressively going down; there are some quite deep areas, particularly where networks act as complex dynamic systems (e.g. congestion control, routing, error checking) and some dry areas (e.g. packet queueing) but it definitely filled in several large gaps in what I had learned from tinkering with web servers etc and it is really good on some areas like cryptography which are important for cybersecurity\n\n\nJeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi, by Geoff Dyer: read it because I bought it for my wife after reading a review but she never read it; it is actually two short books, the first an account of a journalist at the Venice Biennale, with lots of art, sex and booze; the second about (probably) the same person during a prolonged stay in Varanasi where he finally goes a bit mad; it was quite funny at times but I can’t think of much else to say about it\n\n\nJennie Gerhardt by Theodore Dreiser: I had heard the author’s name somewhere and slightly randomly downloaded this from the Gutenberg site as an e-book; it seems like a rather un-American tale of the hardscrabble poverty and hardship of an immigrant family, focussing on the beautiful daughter with a noble soul and what happens to her; there were similarities to Dickens or Zola, or perhaps to Anna of the Five Towns, or to films like Bicycle Thieves; easy to read and moving at times, and I think there is a social message in there somewhere, but most of the characters never really came to life for me\n\n\nCities of the Red Night by William Burroughs: totally random read (someone had left it behind in the place where I stay in Islamabad); seemed like a very weird but inventive and interesting book; a mixture of the occult, human sacrifice, transmigration of souls, time travel, space travel, homoerotic fantasy, clashes between ancient civilisations, a noirish private detective following up missing persons through spiritualism and pagan homosexual rites, references to the ancient and modern cultures in all the places where Burroughs lived and even a bit of epidemiology related to a “radioactive virus”; even a visit to Spetses where I once taught epidemiology; all non-linear, “cut up”, sometimes just consisting of broken phrases; it ends on a bit of a “… and it had all been a dream or a bad trip… or had it?” note; I slightly gave up on it towards the end as it became so cryptic and fractured and there was so much gay sex, but he was definitely a talented guy and it has made me more interested in his (crazy) life and the Beat Generation more generally\n\n\nThings Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe: I’d seen this book recommended a number of times, but it sat on my shelf for years before I actually read it; it describes a period in the life of a family in a village in today’s Nigeria around the time of the scramble for Africa and the sudden transition from traditional African society to imperial administration and Christian proselytism; all human life is here in this short book: what it is to be a man, what it is to be a woman, struggling for existence, vying for status, expectations and disappointment, social structures, customs, superstition and religion, conflict and violence, random ill fortune, power relationships and powerlessness, human cruelty and stupidity, human kindness; deceptively simple (but actually highly lucid) narration, all conveyed without sentimentality; the characters existed for me to the extent that I took the end of chapter 7 very hard; read this book\n\n\nInglorious Empire by Shashi Tharoor: bought it for my wife and she recommended it; anyone who still thinks that Britain was a benign or benevolent coloniser should read this; Tharoor provides extensive evidence that in the big things India’s British rulers were usually greedy, stupid, cruel and/or racist, creating lasting problems for India; highly intelligent and well-written\n\n\nHalf Of A Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: read it because it was on our shelves for some reason; fictional account of the Biafran War in Nigeria, a civil war on ethnic lines; fascinating and I learned more about Nigerian history\n\n\nSteppenwolf by Herman Hesse (in English; translation by Creighton &amp; Sorell): read it because it was banned by the Nazis and celebrated in the 60s and yes OK the Nobel Prize; lonely, depressed, middle-aged litterateur (Orientalist?) with failing health and a failed marriage (i.e. autobiographical thus far - written by Hesse at a time of personal crisis), as alienated from both the proto-fascist and licentious sides of Weimar German society as a wolf from the steppes (the recurring metaphor for the self-destructive “sickness of the soul” part of him) meets tragic free spirit Hermine and transcends suffering through free love, drugs and dancing; pretty wild for something published in 1927, ending with a climactic hallucinatory sequence that allows for multiple interpretations; I’m not sure what lessons the book has, but it did make me think deeply about my own (much happier and more “bourgeois”) life and other paths not taken\n\n\nThe Fall of Berlin 1945 by Antony Beevor: how (and why) the Soviets took Berlin in WW2, thereby ending the war in Europe; read it because I hadn’t read anything by Antony Beevor; as I expected it is the story of the various battles between the Russian and German armies, with walk-on parts for the Allies, the colossal sacrifices on both sides, the privations of civilians, including rape on a massive scale, the crazed leadership of Hitler, the paranoia and manoeuvring of Stalin which ultimately led to the iron curtaining of Europe, the not always impressive roles of Churchill and Roosevelt, the desperate battles for the final key buildings, the suicides of Hitler and other Nazi officials; quite readable but no surprises\n\n\nSwann’s Way by Marcel Proust (in English): in retrospect I could have read this in French but expecting it to be difficult (and being faster in English) I read it in English; quite a long book with a few major sections; I adored the first part which is an exquisite account of childhood summers spent outside Paris in a small rural town (this is at least partly autobiographical); the main character is a highly sensitive, bookish, artistic soul and the writing is superb at conveying both natural beauty and human psychology (I can see why some people re-read and re-read Proust); the famous theme of the power of memory comes out clearly from here; having introduced some important characters who will appear in later sections, this section ends with an account of the author’s painful unrequited infatuation with the daughter of the neighbouring Swann family, and then we have a lengthy flashback to the years before in Paris, when the somewhat libertine gentleman Swann falls rather tediously in love with the faithless courtesan Odette; there’s a lot on the snobbery of the social circles they move in; Swann eventually gets very jealous and stalkery, and the relationship seems to end, but at the end of the book we flash forward to see that they have married (though Odette still “doesn’t let the grass grow beneath her feet” as my dad would put it); Proust just sees and responds to and finds art in so much detail of life that while I wouldn’t rush into another one just yet I can see myself reading more\n\n\nCapital by John Lanchester: readable but insubstantial novel about various Londoners in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis; not usually the sort of thing I go for but I read it because I enjoy the author’s articles in the London Review of Books; you will probably enjoy it if you know more about London than I do\n\n\nA West Pointer with the Boers by John Y. Fillmore Blake: an alternative perspective on the Boer War (aka South African War), from an Irish-American fighting alongside the Boers; read it slightly randomly after browsing the Gutenberg site; interesting for how hated the English/British were by many (not least by Irish nationalists) for this war of aggression, motivated by the Transvaal goldfields; also for how badly the British fought, the unconscionable treatment of civilians and the extensive use of propaganda/press manipulation; as you might expect gives a very favourable account of the Boers and little attention to any indigenous peoples\n\n\nBuddenbrooks by Thomas Mann (in English; Lowe-Porter translation): read it because of the Nobel Prize; I had previously read Mann’s Lotte in Weimar, expecting it to be some sort of sequel to the exhilarating doomed love story in Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther, and was a bit disappointed; the summary of this book (the declining fortunes of a bourgeois late 19th century North German family of grain merchants) doesn’t do it justice; it is actually an affecting humanistic portrayal of real men, women and children trapped by the expectations of their caste and society and trying unsuccessfully to stifle their true natures to do their duty; it is also a detailed ethnographic description of a group of people in a specific period of German history, with wars and revolutions lightly sketched in the background; now I have tuned in to Mann I look forward to reading his other books\n\n\nThe Scramble for Africa by Thomas Pakenham: condensed account of the competition between colonial powers in Africa during 1876-1912 (when seven European countries carved up 90% of Africa); read it because I enjoyed reading his book on the Boer War (while on holiday in South Africa); mostly written from the perspective of the European (and particularly British) protagonists, and based on extensive reading of published and unpublished European sources; fairly honest about the varying mix of mercantile greed, racial superiority, religion and national rivalry that motivated colonialism, under the cover of (sometimes genuine) good intentions to e.g. stop slavery, and the cruelty and countless atrocities that resulted; engagingly written, it succinctly covers a lot of ground in the nearly 700 pages, but in a popular history book like this there’s little room for deeper inquiry; massacres and forced labour are given less prominence than European politics; disappointingly, despite the author’s generally ironic detachment throughout the book, it ends on this note, as though the ends justify the means, that there were no conceivable alternatives, and that freedom and human dignity were exclusively European aspirations:\n\n\n\nYet how many Africans would wish to turn the clock back to the 1880s? The steamers and airlines of the world now bring material benefits to the forty-seven new states of the continent on a scale undreamt of a century ago. Best of all, Europe has given Africa the aspirations for freedom and human dignity, the humanitarian ideals of Livingstone, even if Europe itself was seldom able to live up to them.\n\n\n\nLa Route des Flandres by Claude Simon: read it for no other reason than because the author won a Nobel Prize; had to get used to the unpunctuated Nouveau Roman stream of consciousness style, where most narrative conventions are rejected in favour of a fragmentary accumulation of memories, imaginings and fantasies, which in this book are related to the pointless wartime death of a close relative, which encapsulates the entire futility of war and the humiliation of France; events partly mirror the author’s own experience as a soldier and prisoner of war, down to the details of the smells, the sounds, the dirt, the rain, the fatigue; not an easy read; sentences run over multiple pages, with disorientating segues or overlaps between speakers or scenes (or between reality and imagination); it is also the first book I have read in French for a while; but in summary a deep, poetic and emotionally authentic work\n\n\nTyphoid Mary by Anthony Bourdain: short account of the life of the unfortunate (but reckless) typhoid carrier Mary Mallon, written by a fellow cook; sympathetically tries to understand her motivations (there is little to go on) and historical context to counter previous more sensationalistic accounts; other than revelations such as overworked cooks not always washing their hands probably adds little new; fails to find much controversy; people did repeatedly die due to her actions, though he sometimes seems to be minimising this: Two people were said to have died; her deprivation of liberty, though ethically difficult, was legal, humane and justified by what she did when released the first time\n\n\nAuto da Fe by Elias Canetti: read it I think because someone gave it to me; set between the wars (but published after WW2), it is the story of a reclusive Austrian Orientalist who lives only for books and scholarship; an account of his slide from eccentricity into madness and self-destruction, told through the interior self-justifying monologues of the main character and those who seek to exploit him; the obvious symbolism is that if we each follow our internal obsessional logic to its extreme then it ends in violence and destruction of people and culture; one of those books (like later Beckett) which makes you feel slightly insane while you are reading it\n\n\nDemocracy On The Road by Ruchir Sharma: a journalist’s personal account of the last twenty years of Indian democracy; read it because of a personal recommendation; Sharma is a US-based journalist, originally from India as covered in the first chapter; fascinating picture of Indian democracy: hundreds of political parties, first-past-the-post system, shifting alliances and unstable coalitions, increasing importance of state elections, voting along caste lines, anti-incumbency bias, sympathy votes for politicians who have been to jail, ingratitude to seemingly successful governments, the decline of political dynasties, routinely illegal campaign funding, pork barrel spending, and much more; yet democracy seems secure, and strong (or unpredictable) enough to withstand the rise of a Putin or Erdoğan strongman figure, whatever the concerns about recent developments; however India’s democracy notably doesn’t prevent the atrocious sectarian mob violence that periodically arises; Sharma travels thousands of miles in convoys with fellow journalists, visits numerous political rallies and interviews many major political figures, while also chronicling the uneven economic rise of India, most apparent to the travelling journalist in the quality of roads and hotels; probably not a book to read without any prior knowledge of Indian history and geography, but insightful and well-written\n\n\nEnderby by Anthony Burgess (a single volume containing the first three Enderby novels): read it because I had read a couple of his earlier novels (The Doctor Is Sick, which I had picked up randomly in a bookshop, and later A Clockwork Orange, which is somewhat different from his other novels) and liked his fascination with language; this one is about the (supposedly comic in the vein of Tom Sharpe) misadventures of an ageing poet, with some features familiar from his other books such as unhappy relationships, lapsed Roman Catholicism, two-dimensional female or foreign characters, excessive drinking and erudition, and a fascination with the seamier side of sex among the working class or foreigners; the main character (or perhaps the author?) seems to despise the sociocultural innovations of the 1960s, as perhaps the wartime generation did, and is also an unreconstructed racist and misogynist; there is a lot of bad poetry (I mean a lot; if it is a joke then it wears thin); it was possibly regarded as edgy in its day but really hasn’t aged well\n\n\nThe Art of War by Sun Tzu, translated by Thomas Cleary (no relation): short, aphoristic manual on warfare, with supposedly relevant messages for today e.g. The Way means inducing the people to have the same aim as the leadership, so that they will share death and share life, without fear of danger.; read it because it has come up in various “great books” lists such as this one and also because I am increasingly expected to take on leadership roles (despite reluctance on my part) and thought this might help; there is something relevant on the roles and qualities expected of a leader (e.g. formlessness - I like that term), but a lot more on having a better strategy than your enemy (or competitor) which might be more applicable in a business setting.\n\n\nMoby Dick by Herman Melville: a book I felt I should read but was not expecting to enjoy; finished it while slightly delirious from yet another viral infection, which undoubtedly heightened the later chapters; even if you haven’t read it you probably know that it is a story of fatal obsession with a whale, but the book is actually a mixture of an adventure narrative with lengthy disquisitions on subjects like cetology and worldwide ocean travel, and other writing of a more metaphysical nature -  it is like Joseph Conrad and Charles Darwin took turns writing the chapters; it is not an easy read but the actual story is interesting and ultimately gripping, despite the high-flown archaic language (lots of words that usually mean something else today!) and the inevitable, much-omened outcome; with other books fresh in mind I thought I saw stylistic playfulness and some classic Orientalist stereotypes; overall I would encourage others to read it but not expect to enjoy it, and they will probably get more out of it than they expected. See also this review.\n\n\nInfinite Jest by David Foster Wallace: read it I think because I came across a Reddit thread about it; took me a while and more than one attempt to get into it, as it’s rather “non-linear”; it’s also huge, over 1,000 pages including many footnotes; IJ is a detailed (and sometimes very funny) dystopian vision of the future USA, as seen from the 90s, following the fortunes of quite a few seemingly disconnected characters from elite tennis juniors to government officials to terrorists to various colourful characters with (or recovering from) addiction and mental health issues; if I’m honest I probably enjoyed the bits about the addicts most, which I understand were informed to some extent by personal experience, and it rang true from my own experience (of working with addicts rather than addiction per se); he is unsurprisingly insightful about suicide (the author later committed suicide); there is joy for the reader in his deft humorous touches, playful language and brilliant descriptive flair, but he does make you work for it (apparently deliberately); if I live long enough to read it again (and I might) I would use the extensive footnotes and the wiki for the full experience.\n\n\nOrientalism by Edward Said: read it probably because it was mentioned in relation to TE Lawrence who I have previously read a lot about, e.g. Seven Pillars of Wisdom and Setting The Desert On Fire by my friend James Barr; Said was a Palestinian-American literary academic who made the case that the “Western” (meaning mainly UK, France and US) view of the “East”/“Orient” (his main focus is probably Arabs and Islam, but India, China and Indochina are also mentioned) has often been a useful (or harmful, depending on your viewpoint) caricature, often or even particularly in academic studies, and that that has fed into colonialism, conflict and cultural disdain. The first edition came out in the 70s around the time of the Six Day War and consequent oil embargoes. It is beautifully written and erudite and seems surprisingly fresh and relevant today. I found his arguments coherent and compelling, though did occasionally wonder if he was reading too much in e.g. the sexualised language he detects in texts about the “East” (penetrating the Orient), particularly towards the end where he is describing modern Orientalism and seems occasionally less detached and perhaps even angry. His solutions: humanism; intellectual exchange; see the individual diversity not the the monolithic distancing abstractions/stereotypes. He had a fair few critics (if not enemies) and there have been misinterpretations of his work (e.g. that it is anti-Western; that he is selective with sources; that he wants to make Orientalism a dirty word) but he defends his thesis persuasively in an afterword and preface written later. Thoroughly recommended for anyone looking at the “East” from the “West”, or thinking of penetrating the Orient.\n\n\n\nPre-2023 (mainly 2022 as I read hardly anything in the two years before that)\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics: Designing for Change - A Developing Country Perspective by Sahay et al: probably the most relevant book to my current job; my notes and reflections here\n\n\nErewhon, or Over The Range by Samuel Butler: Victorian-era adventure story/thinly-disguised critique of contemporary society; read it because it apparently prefigures artificial general intelligence; starts well but some chapters hard-going if you’re not living the hypocrisy of Victorian mores.\n\n\nStranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein: read it because it is where the geek word “grok” (as in deeply understand) comes from; 60s science fiction tale of a human born on Mars returning to Earth with supernatural powers and creating a hippie religion; interesting at first but the emphasis is very much on the hippie religion later on.\n\n\nNorwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami: recommended by friends; austere style, mostly conversations; didn’t really care what happened to the characters.\n\n\nPeeling the Onion by Günter Grass: read it as the first part is his account of the war years (when he joined the Waffen SS; he seems honest about his complicity with some of what was going on in Germany); the rest is a less interesting account of his early artistic career post-war.\n\n\nAnna of the Five Towns by Arnold Bennett: read it because I live in Stoke-on-Trent; early 20th century novel set in the Potteries; interesting to learn about the period but the story is unmemorable.\n\n\nA Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe: read it for contemporary resonances and there are lots.\n\n\nThe Heart Is A Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers: hard to describe but I enjoyed it; all about friendship and loneliness.\n\n\nEthan Frome by Edith Wharton: again hard to describe (another “slice of life” book) but touching and sad; enjoyed it.\n\n\nA Gentleman of Leisure by P.G. Wodehouse: read it because my Dad always recommended him but I need more than flashes of witty sarcasm and arch conversation.\n\n\nHTML5: The Missing Manual by Matthew MacDonald: the edition I had was probably a bit out of date, as this kind of book quickly becomes, so skimmed through some bits; most interesting where it summarises the history and controversies of the development of web standards.\n\n\nArsène Lupin by Maurice LeBlanc and others: read it after watching the modern TV adaptation; thought I was reading the first book in the series but it turned out to be a play originally, rewritten as a novel by someone else; mainly driven by the battle of wits between the detective and the audacious thief, but you can see what’s coming a long way off; maybe I should try another one.\n\n\nMy Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell: possible re-read, because I read one of his when I was in my teens and loved it; also because I was on holiday in Corfu; not as funny as I remembered\n\n\nFathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev: read it because my first-year room mate at university used to quote Turgenev (while I was studying anatomy and wishing I was studying French); a student invites his disagreeable nihilist friend from university to his home in boring rural Russia, at a time of massive social change; you’re not sure which side the author is on (e.g. old versus young, science versus tradition), though one protagonist does seem to question his own beliefs and then die later on; a gloomy read but made me a lot more interested in the historical context.\n\n\nBooks I want to get back to\n\n\nGeschichte Europas: Von der Völkerwanderung bis zur Reformation by Henri Pirenne: similar long-term project in German; Belgian historian who was interned during WW1 and gave lectures on European history from memory, later basing this book on them; another big book covering the period from the Dark Ages to the Reformation, highlighting the many continuities rather than seeing it as a total collapse of civilisation; got a couple of hundred pages in but have lost my place and definitely need to restart.\n\n\nStatistical Inference by Roger Berger and George Casella: was drawn to it as it covers several fundamental areas I felt I only partly assimilated during my MSc; also it holds your hand on the maths more than other books I could mention; I think I read the first chapter but the dodgy second-hand print copy I have is badly printed and has bits missing.\n\n\n\nAt a rate of 16 books per year (approx. 20 pages per day) I can read 528 books before I die at the predicted age of 88, assuming reasonable compression of morbidity.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Books/reading/","path":"/notes/Books/reading/","title":"Reading"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Books/the-book-of-why-by-judea-pearl-and-dana-mackenzie-book-notes/":{"body":"\nnot sure it provides its own definition of causality (though does use metaphors about information flowing, or Y “listening to” X), but does critique some previous attempts\nhuman intelligence makes causal inferences, but statistics has often limited itself to statements about associations (“correlation is not causation”), with honourable exceptions\n“data is dumb”: can’t answer causal questions alone, e.g. about interventions, counterfactuals;

Here are some notes on uploading denominator data into DHIS 2 and creating indicators for incidence.\nWe were tasked with creating disease incidence rates using estimated health facility catchment populations as denominators. After many failed attempts at cleaning up some data files I had been sent, that had many spelling variations in the transliteration of names of health facilities, I decided to create a template and ask partners to complete it.\nI downloaded Organisation Unit and Organisation Unit Level from the Import/Export app (Metadata export tab) as uncompressed JSON. This can then be read into R and put into more manageable form with:\n\nYou now have a list of all the organisation units in your system and need to filter to health facilities and show the hierarchy. In our system, organisation units can have the following levels: national (1), provincial (2), district (3), tehsil (4), union council (5) and health facility (6).\nI then divided the data by geographical level:\n\nThe next horrendous bit of code just joins these all up so that you can see the full hierarchy, and saves it as a CSV file:\n\nI could then create a nicely formatted Excel spreadsheet out of this and send it out for completion. I added a column for catchment population denominator and asked for the other columns not to changed. After some months most of the data was in, so I could upload it into DHIS 2.\nIn DHIS 2 I created an aggregate data element for the denominator values, of type “Number” and (very important) aggregation type of “Average”. I took note of the ID of the data element created.\nI could then manually reformat the returned spreadsheet into the format required for import into DHIS 2. It needs to be in CSV format and to have the following structure (first two lines shown only):\ndataelementperiodorgunitcategoryoptioncomboattributeoptioncombovaluestoredbylastupdatedcommentfollowupdeleted\ngEzZS4YRmT02025sgVCYsjiu5iHllvX50cXC0HllvX50cXC02150Paul ClearyRequires annual refresh\n\ncategoryoptioncombo and attributeoptioncombo can be as shown, but add your own IDs and values for the rest.\nUsing the Import/Export app (Data import tab) I imported this into DHIS 2 (select CSV; tick “First row is a header”) after a successful dry run import. After running analytics this was available for analysis and I presented it in some charts in a dashboard for checking (some of the numbers were surprisingly large).\nBefore you can create an indicator for a rate, you need to create an indicator type - this is just a factor that the rate will be multipled with for presentation. I created an indicator type called “Per 100,000” with a factor of 100,000.\nI created a rate indicator for acute watery diarrhoea for starters, specifying presentation with 2 decimal places, the “Per 100,000” indicator type and the numerator (acute watery diarrhoea cases) and denominator (catchment population). If you prefer, you can “annualise” the rate (which for a weekly rate just means multiplying it by 52).

The denominator will need to be updated for 2026 - I have set a calendar reminder.

I usually consciously try to speak slowly but I have realised I may need to do more to increase accessibility for non-native speakers. It’s possible a British accent is more difficult to understand (even in the US I found I needed to speak in a mid-Atlantic way to avoid occasional incomprehension). Recently I was excited to find an easy way to add translated subtitles to a presentation recording without using any online services.\nIf you use Teams as we do, and record a meeting, you can then download the recording as an MP4 file. You can then use a Python package to create and embed subtitles in the file.\nThe original version of the Python package is here: m1guelpf/auto-subtitle: Automatically generate and overlay subtitles for any video. - this allows you to generate subtitles in the language spoken in the video. It uses one of the open source OpenAI Whisper LLMs for this.\nWhisper is also capable of translating into other languages and auto-subtitle has been forked to add this capability to the Python package: adills/auto-subtitle: Automatically generate and overlay subtitles for any video.\nI did the following on Linux (I am still using Elementary OS, based on Ubuntu, though I am itching to change distro again). You should be able to get it to work on Windows if you have permission to install the ffmpeg software.\nNote that I have a GPU on my Linux machine - I am not yet sure if that is required but I don’t think so.\nFirstly install dependencies - note that there are some packages with similar names which will not work, and you may need to uninstall those:\n\nInstall the Python package from the forked repo:\n\nYou can then add English subtitles with e.g.:\n\nIt will create a “subtitled” folder if none exists and the subtitled video file will be in there when it is finished. The English subtitles were very accurate, even with my weird accent.\nAt my first attempt the file created could not be opened on Windows or Linux. Thinking the video file from Teams might contain some weird codecs, I converted it to .webm format with the code below (which took hours, multiple times the duration of the video) and the video file was then viewable. At later attempts this was not required. I think I had possibly tried to open it before it was completely finished.\n\nTo add subtitles translated into a different language (here Urdu, but quite a few languages are available) I used:\n\nAfter a long wait, this produced what a colleague has told me is an accurate translation into Urdu, but with the words broken in a way impeding readability.

A password manager is a software tool running on your computer and/or in your browser which helps you keep track of your login details for different websites. The key advantage is that you can create a different long, complex password (I use at least 20 characters from a-z, A-Z, 0-9 plus special characters) for every site without having to remember any of them; the downside is if your password manager gets hacked. However, if your alternative to using a password manager is to use the same passwords (or variations) across sites, then that is far more risky. The UK National Cybersecurity Centre now recommends the use of password managers.\nI used LastPass for several years and was happy with it, but after they got hacked to some extent a couple of times, and my subscription came to  its end, I decided to switch to hosting my own password manager with Vaultwarden, an open-source version of Bitwarden. It was easy to set up and to transfer my existing passwords from LastPass. It works well with the Bitwarden extension for Firefox and can handle the new passkeys that may replace passwords in future. It can also take care of multi-factor authentication, though that’s too many eggs in one basket for me - I use MFA wherever I can but manage that separately.\nI find that open-source software often has all the features I need, sometimes even before I realise I need them. As part of my laboratory work I was looking for a way to securely send links (via SMS ultimately) to download lab reports, when I realised that Vaultwarden can do this too, using Bitwarden Send.\nIt creates a URL which allows you to share some text or a file - you can add a password, or specify an expiry period. You can can do it in the Web app or via a command-line interface if you need to automate the process.\nI’ve played with the CLI tool but I’m still thinking about how it would fit into my desired workflow. It’s not difficult to set up; there is nothing to do at the server end, just download and unzip the CLI executable to your local machine.  Installation instructions and the list of commands are here.\nAt the time of writing, the latest versions of the tool have a bug which stops you sending file attachments; I found that using the 1.22.1 version from here worked fine.\nA sample session (in Windows here) could be (there are many more commands):\n\n(I’m still using R for things I should be using Python for) so my next question was: can I automate this in R? The answer is yes, though it is a bit more complicated. You need to log in to the web app and go to Security/Settings/Keys to get your API key. Your API key will be in two parts: an ID and a secret, which are both just text. Once you have these, you have all the information necessary and can save it securely on your local machine with the following R code:\n\nMake sure that the unzipped, downloaded CLI executable is in the same directory as the R code.\nYou can then use the following R function to get a session key:\n\nExample usage would be:\n\nThe following two functions allow you send either text or a file:\n\nTo send some text (and view the result):\n\nTo send a file (and view the result):\n\nNext I needed to work out how to interact with the API of an SMS gateway to be able to send the URL as a text - that can be a future post.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Misc/automating-bitwarden-send/","path":"/notes/Misc/automating-bitwarden-send/","title":"Automating Bitwarden Send"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Misc/how-to-create-a-bluesky-feed/":{"body":"\nYou need a Bluesky account, and to create an app password in the Bluesky site: Settings –&gt; Privacy and Security –&gt; App passwords\nNext log in to SkyFeed with your Bluesky user name and the app password from the previous step\nSkyFeed has quite a busy interface - what you are looking for is “Feed Builder” (in the left hand column) then “Create Feed” at the top of the interface that opens\nYou can then add blocks - these run from top to bottom - mine were:\n\nInput: entire network, 7 days\nRemove: if item is reply\nRemove: duplicates\nRegex with “Invert” ticked: add a regular expression here to filter out patterns you don’t want - use \\b to delineate words, e.g. \\bsex\\b will remove posts with “sex” but not “Essex”\nRegex with “Invert” not ticked: add a regular expression for what you want here - mine is below (used lots of trial and error and help from chatbots)\n\n\n\nSort by: random\n\n\n\nYou can see the result of mine here: EpiNerd — Bluesky - it still includes some weird things (mute or block them if they keep appearing)\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Misc/how-to-create-a-bluesky-feed/","path":"/notes/Misc/how-to-create-a-bluesky-feed/","title":"How to create a Bluesky feed"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Misc/moocs/":{"body":"Currently doing this free online edX course: HarvardX: Causal Diagrams: Draw Your Assumptions Before Your Conclusions | edX and it’s really good.

I ended up going down a Web development rabbithole and got fed up with both Web development and Quarto.\n\nNew blog\nI have never tried blogging before, though I have often considered it. I showed a few interesting things to a colleague recently, who asked me if I had a blog. So I have just spent half a day (of annual leave) setting up a blog with the R package blogdown (which uses Hugo), GitHub and Netlify. Kudos to https://github.com/ojroques who created and shared the theme I am using. I am using ForwardEmail to forward email from the email address below to my own personal email. So it has all cost me nothing except time (OK I have to pay for the domain name), which was part of the challenge.\nThis occasional blog is just for me to share things that might be useful to others, like training materials in draft, or where I have managed to help someone with a problem and learnt something in the process, or how to do things, or useful collated resources, and also for me to clarify my thinking in some areas by writing it down. It is not for self-promotion and I am not looking for another job, so I won’t be tweeting about it or otherwise advertising it - if you are reading this, you are a member of a very select set that I have shared this with. Check out the RSS feed below if you are interested in following the blog. I probably won’t post more than weekly. I follow a lot of blogs (too many) using a self-hosted instance of Miniflux which I read on my phone with FeedMe.\nI am a well-rounded geek with a lot of interests, but I intend to restrict this blog to technical matters of possible interest to epidemiologists, analysts of infectious disease surveillance data, R users, Python users, data scientists, and anyone else whose primary job relates to data and analysis, perhaps particularly health data, but who is also interested in other related technologies, in particular open source software. Let’s see how it goes.\n\nFirst define your terms\nWhy have I called this blog epidemiologydatascience.net? Data science wasn’t a term I used much prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. I had a vague idea that data scientists were just people who used both R and Python, and probably worked for Google or Facebook.\nDuring the pandemic, those self-identifying as epidemiologists were often thrown together with those self-identifying as data scientists. I realised that some epidemiologists do data science of a sort, and that data scientists can do epidemiology.  Some mathematical modellers or statisticians realised that they could call themselves epidemiologists (it was probably not entirely coincidental that this was a term that the general public had become increasingly familiar with) but some could have called themselves data scientists instead. And many noticed how their roles were overlapping with those of their IT and informatics colleagues.\nSo I think there is a rich multi/interdisciplinary area which could be called epidemiology data science (or epidemiological data science). I am certainly not the first to think this or to consider the implications for traditional skill sets and career pathways. How do we define epidemiology data science (at least for the purposes of this blog)?\nEpidemiology is variously defined, e.g. as the (soft) basic science of public health practice, or the discipline of asking what/how many/where/when/who/why questions about the health of populations. Data science is similarly tricky to pin down, as the data science skill set varies according to the domain of application, but at its broadest it could be defined as a discipline that learns from data using any of a wide range of (typically quantitative) analytical methods, sometimes in combination with elements of informatics/data engineering, software development and/or use of information and communication technologies (i.e. computers and networks).\nSo epidemiology data science could be briefly defined as the interdisciplinary study of population health data using quantitative analytical methods and computing technologies. I could add e.g. “… to protect public health” but I don’t want to exclude those working in academia (for whom knowledge creation could be an end in itself), or in industry (for whom the company bottom line could be the motivator), or any evil epidemiology data scientists who actually want to harm public health.\nSo what does this mean for someone like me, who came to epidemiology from a health or health science background and could conceivably have learned very little about analytical methods or computing technologies during my career?\nWhen I came into public health, a typical public health professional would be forced to learn some epidemiology and statistics at a couple of points in their early career. Afterwards they would usually forget any theory, which had only been hazily appreciated anyway, but retain enough useful rules of thumb such as “chi-squared test compares proportions” or “t test compares means” to be able to supervise junior staff doing basic analysis; more complicated stuff would definitely require a statistician. My typical public health professional might find learning more advanced methods painful. As a practically-focussed adult learner they might object to learning theory, however simplified, and might expect to be taught a practical and unequivocal rule-based approach similar to what they had retained for chi-squared tests etc (and ideally done by clicking a button), which would only be possible to a degree.\nFortunately, I think this caricature is increasingly untrue. Almost everyone seems to want to “learn R” these days (OK maybe not the Stata and Python users) - that’s an excellent way into epidemiology data science. The diversity of skills has grown in public health teams as a result of the pandemic. We have novel health data sources and more accessible analytical methods and computing technologies than you can shake a stick at, largely thanks to the open source philosophy. Whether we call it that or not, I think the future is bright for epidemiology data science.\n\nIn which I start to do something practical\nI was going to speak my mind about the kind of skills that I think epidemiology data scientists should acquire, but I have been distracted by something more interesting and practical. It’s actually something related to something that I have been working on previously and now need to make some serious progress with.\nThe task in hand is: reproduce a surveillance report that is currently produced manually and formatted laboriously in Word. I have done a version in RMarkdown, with a Word template, but I haven’t been able to reproduce a few things like mixing text boxes with a multicolumn format. My version probably looks fine as it is, but I still think I can do better (meaning closer to the original).\nThere is only so much you can do with basic RMarkdown. But HTML^[HyperText Markup Language] (the markup language behind Web pages) is much more flexible. Markdown was originally conceived as a simplified way of writing Web pages, so if you understand some Markdown you can easily understand basic HTML. I would recommend all epidemiology data scientists to at least do the basic W3Schools HTML course.\nHTML is even more flexible when combined with CSS^[Cascading Style Sheets] (which is a way of defining the styles, such as size, colour, font, etc, for each part of a Web page and/or for the page overall). You can do a lot with some understanding of CSS, so doing enough of the W3Schools course to get the general idea should be enough for most epidemiology data scientists. CSS does get very complex beyond a certain level.\nThe problem with creating a report as a Web page is that it may not look very good once printed, either to paper or PDF. You have little control on where pages begin and end. A few years ago I came across a solution to this called paged.js, a JavaScript library “… that paginates any HTML content to produce beautiful print-ready PDF”. JavaScript is the programming language of the Web, which runs in your browser to give your Web pages interactivity and other functionality. A library is a collection of code which allows a Web page to do something, and it is most often downloaded from the Web at the same time as the Web page using it. Pagination simply means breaking into pages (in a way that is under your control). At the time I didn’t know enough about JavaScript to know where to start with paged.js, though you could clearly do beautiful things with it.\nI did play with a self-hosted instance of jsreport for a while, which is a very nice platform allowing you to create Web pages which are already paginated nicely for printing. It did allow me to create the more complex format that I was looking for. But in the end I realised it would not be easily integrated with my RMarkdown workflow.\nFortunately in recent years someone produced an R package which allows you to use paged.js: the pagedown package. This (and related packages) provide templates for various documents such as reports and business cards. So if I can create my own custom pagedown template (using HTML and CSS) I can integrate this nicely into my workflow. If I can make the template generic enough and build it into an R package, it can be used for other similar reports by colleagues.\nIn my next post I will get the basics working: setting up a new R package, creating a very basic pagedown template in it and putting everything on GitHub. After that I can develop it further and demonstrate something about HTML, CSS, fonts, SVG and perhaps even JavaScript.\n\nIn which I become a Web developer\nIn my quest to develop a pagedown template,  I have realised why authors of other pagedown templates tend to provide one or more templates as is, with limited flexibility on overall format. It is because R users (including myself) tend not to be Web developers, and developing a pagedown template (though not using the pagedown package per se) really tests your basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Some examples of this approach are:\n\npagedown: the main package\npagedreport: a few more additional templates\nsgdf_pagedown: a template for youth paramilitary organisations\n\nanother template derived from sgdf_pagedown: INRAE_pagedown_template\n\n\nanother poster style\nanother CV/résumé style\nanother derivative one here\n\nIf I don’t surpass this with my own template, I hope to expose the internals enough to make it modifiable without being an expert in HTML/CSS.\nThe next thing I realised is that you don’t need the pagedown package to use paged.js. It provides some convenience functions but you can manage just fine without it. I started off with an existing pagedown template, aiming to modify it for my own needs, as others have done, and ended up with something that worked but which I didn’t fully understand. So I became interested to see if I could start with nothing and create my own template from scratch, without using the pagedown package.\nI’ve also realised that to explain what I am doing properly would take several blog posts. So in this post I will focus on how you can use HTML and CSS (with paged.js) to set up a basic Web page that can be printed to paginated PDF. Then I will develop it further with CSS to look like a report. Then I will show how to turn it into a template for RMarkdown. And finally I will make it into a package.\nA minimal starting point for an HTML Web page is shown below. You can copy this code into a blank text file, call it something like simple_html_template.html and save it to a new folder on your Desktop. I explain what each part of the HTML means below.\nApart from the first line, which tells your browser that the text file it has just opened is a Web page, HTML is basically text and tags.\n\nThe text is usually what appears on the Web page. We haven’t added any text to our example yet so it would just be a blank page if you opened the file in your browser.\nThe tags (the bits surrounded by angle brackets, e.g. &lt;body&gt;) indicate the structure of the page: what is a heading, what is a paragraph, etc.\nWhere tags need to surround something, they come in pairs, with an opening tag looking like &lt;tag&gt; and a closing tag looking like &lt;/tag&gt;. It doesn’t matter if paired tags are on the same line as what they are enclosing.\nIt is common practice to indent things between tags for readability, but that is optional.\n\n\nNote that everything after the first line is “nested” within a pair of &lt;html&gt; tags. Within that there are two parts, called the head and the body, which are each demarcated by their own tags. Other things are nested within the head and body tags.\nThe head is where you put the metadata for the Web page. Metadata (basically meaning “information about information”) is information about the Web page, such as information that the browser needs to show the page correctly. Metadata is usually not of interest to the user and so is not shown in the browser.\nOne important piece of metadata for the Web page is what character encoding system is in use. Computers use numbers to represent (or, to put it more technically, encode) characters (such as letters, numbers or punctuation) and there are different ways of doing that. When the computer sees a number, if you haven’t told it which system to use, it might show the wrong character. The UTF-8 system is widely used because it compactly represents over 100,000 characters, including those from foreign languages, mathematical symbols etc etc. &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt; is telling the browser to use the UTF-8 system.\nThe other piece of metadata that is shown here is the page title. The page title is important: it defines what is shown in the browser tab at the top of your page, but it is also what is shown if someone finds your page via a search engine or bookmarks your site. We can make the page title “Report” if we amend the code to show:\n\nYou may have noticed that the opening &lt;html&gt; tag contained lang=\"en\". This is also metadata, telling your browser that your page contains English text.\nThe head section is also where you link your page to other resources such as files containing CSS formatting rules or JavaScript code. We will do this in a minute.\nThe body section is in general where we put the content that the user will see. To add one simple line of text to the page, we can use paragraph tags (&lt;p&gt;). Our HTML file now looks something like this:\n\nNote that you can miss out certain tags (and let your browser guess which bits of your page are which) but it will cause you problems when you get to the CSS part.\nSo now we have a valid HTML page. We can open it in our browser and admire our handiwork. The next step is to add pagination. At the moment we need JavaScript to do this, though one day it should be possible to do this using only CSS.\nWe use &lt;script&gt; tags to include JavaScript in a Web page. You can include actual JavaScript code between these tags, or just point to an external file containing JavaScript code. The external file can be on your own computer or somewhere else on the Internet. paged.js is a JavaScript “library” (collection of code) which adds pagination to your page. It is an example of a “polyfill”: a JavaScript library that enables browsers to do things that they can’t do with existing standard HTML etc. Many such JavaScript libraries are made available for use by “content delivery networks”, or CDNs. CDNs are basically Web services which rapidly provide commonly used resources to Web pages, which basically makes the Internet faster. To add paged.js to our Web page requires only one line of code:\n\nYou can put this anywhere between the &lt;html&gt; tags, but it is common to put it at the end of the &lt;body&gt; section (i.e. on the line just before &lt;/body&gt;), because sometimes this makes your page appear more quickly to the user.\npaged.js allows us to use CSS to paginate a Web page. So let’s add some CSS code. We can add CSS code directly into our Web page using &lt;style&gt; tags, or link our Web page to a file containing CSS code using a &lt;link&gt; tag. The CSS code could again be on our own computer or somewhere else on the Internet, such as on a CDN. Here we will use &lt;style tags to include some CSS directly into our HTML file.\nNow our page looks something like this:\n\nNote the part between &lt;style&gt; tags. In CSS code, anything that starts with a @ is a special instruction to the browser. Here we are giving some special instructions to our browser that we want certain things to happen when we print the Web page to PDF. We want the page size to be A4 and in portrait orientation. We want 5cm margins for the page. We also want the bottom centre part of the margin to contain a page counter (i.e. a page number).\nIf we save our HTML file, open it in our browser and print it to PDF, it should look like this:\n\nYou now have a simple PDF from paginated HTML (note the page number). In the next post I will develop a somewhat more sophisticated version of this.\n\nCascading Style Sheets for Epidemiology Data Scientists\nCSS is easy\nI have spent some weeks now delving into the complexities of CSS, the formatting language of the Web. CSS is easy at a basic level. If you want your paragraph text to be red, then all you need is:\n\nThe p refers to the &lt;p&gt; element or elements in your web page.\nThere are many such simple properties that you can set for your Web page, and tons of reference material where you can look them up, such as this.\nCSS is difficult\nCSS gets complicated beyond a certain level (OK so probably everything does 😀). What makes CSS hard in my limited exposure is:\n\n\nBrowsers. Users will view your web page using Chrome, or Safari, or Firefox, or Edge, or an old version of Internet Explorer, or on a mobile device, or on something else. These can all “render” (i.e. show) your web page in different ways. They also support the latest features of HTML and CSS in varying ways (or not at all) and this can change over time. So something which looks good to you can look a bit rubbish when viewed by others.\nSo what can you do?\nYou can write CSS which caters to different browsers by having different rules for each type of browser (using something called browser prefixes), which is a faff.\nYou can try to stick to CSS which is supported by “modern browsers” (which usually means not old versions of anything and in particular not old versions of Internet Explorer) and tell users which browsers to use, which may only work if you have a captive audience.\nYou can use a CSS reset (a ready-made set of rules which removes browser inconsistencies) or a CSS framework (ready-made sets of rules allowing you to build web sites more quickly), which can mean learning a new syntax as well as learning CSS.\nIn my template I have used a CSS reset called Normalize.css. I have managed not to use a CSS framework, though I was sorely tempted.\n\n\nLayout and flow. Layout in CSS is tricky, and particularly tricky if you are trying to design a document that fits neatly onto A4 pages. Normal web pages can scroll infinitely (down or sideways) and don’t need to break at the margins of pages.\nYou have to grasp a number of concepts and models to understand how to lay out a web page with CSS, including the box model, the display property, absolute and relative positioning, floats and the various units used for sizing things, which are all beyond the scope of this blog post. In addition there are newer layout models called Flexbox and Grid, which (though powerful) I tried to avoid using/learning as they didn’t seem to help much with print layout and may actually break it. I recommend the Interneting is Hard site if you want to learn more about CSS layout.\nI wanted a header section showing the title, institution and a couple of logos. I wanted the main body of the document to be a mixture of one or two columns, with some images fitting within a column and some taking the whole width of the document. I wanted the possibility of text boxes at various locations. This was all tricky; for example, it was easy to create a two-column section, but how do I stop the contents of a column flowing into the next page rather than into the second column on the same page? This was probably the most difficult part of all of it. There are developing areas of CSS such as CSS Regions which may make similar print layout/flow tasks easier in future.\n\n\nSpecificity. Help! I have added a CSS rule and my browser has ignored it! My paragraph text is not red! A CSS rule is actually more of a suggestion to your browser about how something should be formatted. Your browser has to reconcile formatting suggestions from a number of sources. There are the rules you added, many more rules already included in the web page and any CSS frameworks it uses, and the last-resort rules that the browser itself applies. It is inevitable that the same component of a web page (e.g. the paragraph text that you want to be red) ends up being targeted by multiple rules.\nThe browser decides which rule to apply based on a number of criteria such as where the rule comes from and how specific it is. A rule is more likely to be applied if it is in the web page code (rather than in a separate file) and if it targets something very specific, like paragraph text in a particular section of the web page rather than targetting all paragraph text elements.\nThis didn’t turn out to be a big issue for me. You just have to remember that when you specify a CSS rule you may be overriding an existing rule, and so the more specific you make it the better. There is a sort of CSS trump card that you can pull out in desperation (adding !important to your rule) but it seems to be regarded as poor style and an admission of ignorance and defeat. It isn’t even guaranteed to work (the rule you are trying to override may also have !important)!\n\n\nPrint CSS learning resources. Most CSS out there is aimed at developers who want to create web pages that look good both on big desktop screens and small mobile devices - known as responsive design. There is much less prior art out there for print CSS. Much of that is aimed at developers who want to develop an alternate printable version of their website, rather than those primarily targeting print/PDF. Much of the relevant CSS resources that I did find assumed I wanted to create a whole book rather than just a report.\n\n\nI will spend the rest of this blog post summarising a few of the more useful things I found to help me design my report with CSS.\nResources for print CSS\nOf course I started out looking for someone who had done something similar so that I could take it apart to understand it.\nThe closest I could find was was PubCSS, which are HTML/CSS templates providing standard academic conference proceedings as printable HTML (there is something similar here). It was quite useful for the example code (though I wanted something less academic), but it relies on using some non-open source software called Prince for printing, which wouldn’t have fitted into the workflow I was imagining. There is an open source tool called Vivliostyle for creating PDF using HTML and CSS, which looks promising and which I will come back to at some point. I have some previous experience of using another tool called Weasyprint and another tool called wkhtmltopdf. But I wanted something that could be printed from any modern browser without external tools.\nCode examples from the Prince and Vivliostyle documentation were useful. The old Paged Media site is still useful, though the documentation at pagedjs.org now probably covers all or most of that. I found a couple of free books such as this one from a company called Antenna House. There are a few good articles but usually focussing on book creation without going into more complex layouts.\nNext post I will definitely share the template and explain the CSS that I used.\n\nThe perils of perfectionism\n\nI am still not happy with this\n\nSince my last post I have learned a vast amount about CSS and other things - too much to include in one blog post. I must set myself more realistic and discrete goals.\nHere is the latest version [NB: not shown - it wasn’t that good].\n\nIt isn’t what I intended, but it looks OK for a first try. I was aiming for something like a parish newsletter, with minimal white space, but after playing with CSS and Google Fonts a lot ended up with this. You may recognise the content - if you don’t, check this out.\nThe RMarkdown is below. The first thing to note is the YAML at the top, delimited by ---. Any values you supply here will be slotted into the template that Pandoc uses when your final document is created. In the Pandoc template, the placeholders for these values are indicated by dollar signs. For example, the value for author in the YAML will replace the placeholder $author$ in the template. This is all documented here. By including the CSS in my template (when it could have been a separate file) I could allow users to specify formatting options, such as fonts, in the YAML.\nThe next thing to notice is that I am using Pandoc fenced divs to apply CSS classes (i.e. specific formatting) to sections of text. This allows you to do things like create fancy boxes, or change between single and double column formatting.\nNote also how the template to use is defined in the YAML.\nThe template is also below. I have tried to document each part of it, but as I worked on it for quite some time, I don’t remember why I did every thing. Notable features include:\n\nIt makes some attempt to cater for older browsers (though that is increasingly unnecessary) and also uses a CSS reset to minimise differences in browser rendering.\nIt uses Google Fonts. I played with different combinations for too long. You can change these in the YAML, though not all seemed to work for me.\nThe CSS is embedded in the HTML. It makes some limited use of CSS variables to avoid retyping things. A lot of the CSS is only relevant to paged.js. I don’t entirely understand the use of string-set for setting values that appear in the running footer.\n\nNext step is to create an R package for deployment and put it all on GitHub, which will be among my next posts. I will try to post some more fun stuff, that doesn’t require quite so much effort on my part.\nThe RMarkdown\n\nThe HTML template\n\n\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Misc/stuff-i-found-from-years-ago-when-i-was-going-down-a-web-developmentprint-css-rabbithole/","path":"/notes/Misc/stuff-i-found-from-years-ago-when-i-was-going-down-a-web-developmentprint-css-rabbithole/","title":"Stuff I found from years ago when I was going down a Web development/Print CSS rabbithole"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Misc/useful-javascript-snippets/":{"body":"\n\nExtract Outlook or Proton webmail info to add to task list\nThe most reliable method I have found for avoiding productive procrastination (where you keep busy all day, but avoid important tasks you are still processing subconsciously or have a mental block on) is to randomise my tasks.

I didn’t try containers but am sure it would have been the same.\nThere are a number of different ways of setting up networking in Proxmox: basically bridging, routing and NAT. I will attempt to summarise what I think I know about these options.\nBridging is the default for Proxmox and is probably the norm for corporate internal networks in which devices access the Internet via a “gateway” (device which connects your internal network to the Internet). With bridging, VMs access the internet via a shared virtual software interface called a Linux Bridge (usually called vmbr0 in configuration files) which acts like a “switch” and is basically connected directly to the Internet. A switch is a network device that reads the destination addresses on packets and passes them on in the required direction, like a mail sorting office does with letters. You can have multiple bridges with different IP addresses if required.\nIn some circumstances you might not be able to use bridging. Routing (in the Proxmox sense) is an alternative networking setup which basically adds another virtual device between the VMs and the interface with the Internet. You can still use multiple IP addresses.\nWith NAT (network address translation; also called masquerading), specified ports on your VMs are “forwarded” to the network interface by your firewall.\nPorts are just a way of representing multiple networking connections to one server. A server might have several connections running: a web service, an SSH connection and other things too. As the server only has one IP address, you need some way of specifying which bit of the server to connect to for a particular purpose, which is where ports come in. Think of ports as numbered connections to a single machine.  Certain services tend to run on ports with certain numbers: SSH typically runs on port 22 (though you can change this to slightly slow down someone trying to hack your SSH connection). Other ports are free for use and allocated when needed.\nNAT is where you map a port on the host to a port on a VM. You are effectively replacing the port on the host with the port on the VM.\nIt is probably the most straightforward option if you have a server with a hosting provider and only one public IP address, and the one I went with.\nHaving figured this out, I still couldn’t make it work. I looked at a lot of different Proxmox network configurations that I found on the Web, in forums etc. Mine looked fine but for no apparent reason did not work. In the various forums there are many despairing wannabe Proxmox users and many astoundingly patient people trying to help them. I then got a clue from somewhere that something might have gone wrong during the installation and so I re-ran the installation script right from the installimage stage. This, plus very carefully making sure my /etc/network/interfaces file looked very much like the one in this, did the trick.\nNote that it seems you need to reboot the Proxmox host after any change in network configuration before concluding it has not worked.\nMy VMs could now access the Internet and I was able to configure static IP addresses for each of them on installation (this means that the IP addresses of my VMs within Proxmox will not change, say after a reboot).\nI started off using the ufw firewall for the Proxmox host as I couldn’t find much information on the Web about the Proxmox firewall. At one point I foolishly turned on the data centre level Proxmox firewall and lost access to everything, having to resort to the Hetzner rescue system (more than once), and eventually managing to disable the main firewall and regain access via a rather convoluted way. More guidance on getting out of that here.\nEventually I found some guidance here on how to configure the various Proxmox firewalls - it is not great but it was enough.\nNow once I had a new service up and running on a VM, I just needed to add a firewall rule forwarding the service port to the host.\nIn the end I went with Nginx Proxy Manager in an LXC container with some help from this YouTube video and this page. Now I can easily point various subdomains to different services on Proxmox using HTTPS without any need to mess with the firewall.\n\n\nSecond problem I ran into was running out of space! When I was installing the first (or maybe the second) VM, the system went down entirely and refused to come back up. It turned out that the default disk configuration I had used had given me only a small root partition which soon filled up.\nI managed to access the system via the rescue system, deleted some logs (and the Ubuntu ISO file) and managed to restart the system. I then expanded the root partition to fill all available space with the following command\nlvresize -l +100%FREE --resizefs /dev/mapper/vg0-root\n\n\nThird problem was small console text size for VMs (haven’t worked out how to use SPICE yet) but my solution is here.\n\n\nI also did some additional configuration of Proxmox using Proxmox Toolbox, such as smart self-tests (couldn’t get email notifications to work however).\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Proxmox/next-steps-with-proxmox/","path":"/notes/Proxmox/next-steps-with-proxmox/","title":"Next steps with Proxmox"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Proxmox/proxmox-your-own-data-centre/":{"body":"I want to do more experimentation with virtualisation and containerisation, but don’t want to keep paying additional sums for things I might spin up on cloud providers like Hetzner or Digital Ocean.

I take snapshots, though not perhaps as frequently as I should, and periodically back up my Nextcloud files and other key stuff to an external drive (Nextcloud syncs with my main home Linux box). So not quite a 3-2-1 backup strategy. I’ve also got a mailserver running on a separate (much lower spec) VM for a local football club I do some admin stuff for (use MailInABox for this and had to interact with Google, Microsoft and others to get the IP address off various spam blacklists). I’ve also temporarily set up various other more expensive VPSs to experiment with things like DHIS 2 over the years.\nI read a lot about tools like Vagrant, Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes and similar things which have the potential to automate the process of spinning up containers or virtual machines, installing and configuring software and thereafter doing the maintenance and monitoring. I’ve used Ansible in a small way (I can now update my existing VMs with a single command), and managed to get Vagrant working with VirtualBox on my work laptop once. I even did a CloudFoundry course once and managed to use that to deploy a Shiny app. So lots of tinkering so far.\nI work with colleagues abroad who have access to a data centre and realise that if I am to make any significant contribution to establishing a sustainable information system architecture based on open source software I need access to something similar without bankrupting myself (I regard this as a hobby that massively informs and helps my work, so costs are on me). There are various “free tiers” on things like Amazon Web Services that you can play on, but I have read horror stories of people being faced with bills of tens of thousands of dollars for accidental usage. I have a free tier account on AWS but have been a bit too scared to play with it using things like Terraform or Kubernetes for that reason.\nWhich is where Proxmox comes in: Proxmox - Powerful open-source server solutions. According to the website:\n\nProxmox VE is a complete open-source platform for enterprise virtualization. With the built-in web interface you can easily manage VMs and containers, software-defined storage and networking, high-availability clustering, and multiple out-of-the-box tools on a single solution.\n\nThis is an open source product from a commercial company; the product is available for free, but they make their money from support contracts, training and the like. This makes it very popular among self-hosting/home server folk, particularly those who are actually running their own physical servers at home. I had wondered if I could recycle any of a few old bits of kit (mainly past-it laptops) I have lying round at home into a home server setup, but there are reasons why we stopped using them (either they are very slow or there is something wrong with them) so that has never really appealed.\nI’ve been interested in using Proxmox for years but the simplicity and convenience of CapRover (plus not having my own physical server, plus the fact that Proxmox users seem to be technically a cut above us simpler CapRover-using souls) stopped me using it - until now…\nLast night at around midnight I splurged a little (I am worth it) on renting a dedicated server from Hetzner. This means there is now a physical server in Helsinki with my name on it for my exclusive use. Hetzner run an “auction” (it doesn’t really seem like an auction) where you can rent older kit at bargain prices. LowEndBox is good for finding deals like this: LowEndBox - Cheap VPS, Dedicated Servers and Hosting Deals. I wasn’t expecting a quick response from Hetzner but in no time they gave me access and of course I had to then spend half the remaining night setting it up. My lovely server has 64GB of RAM, a multicore i7 CPU and (after taking account of the RAID mirroring I set up) about 500GB of storage.\nFor the installation of Proxmox I used bits and pieces of information from several sources, which I will link to below. Most tutorials tell you to install Debian then install Proxmox on top of that, but Hetzner have an unofficial image you can use which comes with an “installimage” script that basically installs Proxmox for you, once you have specified a domain name and how you want your storage to be organised. I created a subdomain on my main domain with an A record pointing at the server IP address. (I originally bought my domain name from GoDaddy but now use CloudFlare as my name servers. Cloudflare proxying doesn’t work out of the box with Proxmox but I can come back to that later.)\nThe following links were useful:\n\nproxmox-hetzner-autoconfigure/INSTALLING-PROXMOX.md at master · johnknott/proxmox-hetzner-autoconfigure · GitHub - this was the one I was reading when it finally clicked for me how you did it - I followed the same storage setup - gave a useful tip about what to do when you lose SSH access (as happened to me) - it has a follow-on section on configuration and provides a Python script to automate this though this didn’t work for me.\nHetzner Dedicated with Debian 10 and Proxmox 6 (LXC) + Docker-CE + Portainer [NAT] · GitHub - this gist was really helpful for some of the later stages: setting up HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt, installing and setting up Docker and Portainer, setting up fail2ban and the firewall.\n\nYou end up with a system that you can access via SSH as root. You can also access the Web interface on port 8006, logging in with your root password. This seems very insecure and goes against the grain for me, but I suppose Proxmox is designed for the data centre and not the public Internet. So I have some more work to make this more secure, with SSH keys and a VPN for access.\nInitial impressions are good. One minor annoyance is that you keep getting messages saying that you shouldn’t really use the free version for anything serious. I found a trick (sadly can’t find the page now) for removing this message fairly easily however. Edit: found it - First steps with Proxmox VE - Danatec Blog\nI have uploaded an Ubuntu 22.04 ISO image which I can now build virtual machines with. I also want to upload an OVA image of OpenELIS, which is not in the right format for Proxmox but can still be used - see links below:\n\nImport OVA as Proxmox VM | It’s full of stars!\nInstall .ova Image on Proxmox\nHow to Import OVA to Proxmox » SYNCBRICKS - Information Technology for everyone\n\nSo I now effectively have my own data centre. Next is to work out how I can use it for automatically provisioning and setting up VMs using Terraform and Ansible, and hopefully also play with Kubernetes clusters (for which I intend to look at kind). Ultimately if all goes well I can start to consolidate my various services with this.\nEdit: have now added two-factor authentication, though more to do\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Proxmox/proxmox-your-own-data-centre/","path":"/notes/Proxmox/proxmox-your-own-data-centre/","title":"Proxmox: your own data centre"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Python/":{"body":"Python-related notes.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Python/","path":"/notes/Python/","title":"Python"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Python/should-i-learn-python-now-i-know-r/":{"body":"In response to a query from a colleague:\n\nIt depends what you need. I would still recommend R as the first programming language to learn for anyone working in epidemiology or academia - I would say it is the best option for biostatistics, data visualisation, report automation and cutting-edge statistical methods.\n\n\nOnce you have got to a reasonable level in R then learning some Python is not difficult and can be valuable. Python is a general-purpose language with much broader applications than R, and has the advantage in some areas like machine learning, data engineering, and app/Web app development. Python is probably the easiest programming language to learn (R can be quirky and inconsistent). And a lot of what you learned with R is transferable. There is a Python module (equivalent of an R package) called pandas which allow you to write Python code that is often similar to tidyverse or data.table R code – see e.g. https://gist.github.com/conormm/fd8b1980c28dd21cfaf6975c86c74d07.\n\n\nI wouldn’t recommend everyone learns both (I know both and still manage to do everything I need in R, but can read/run Python code if I need to), but possible advantages of learning some Python as well when you are a competent R coder could include:\n\n\n\nIt opens up a world of things you can’t (or shouldn’t try to) do in R.\nIt helps with collaboration across the diverse data science communities. Data science is increasingly bilingual. Some projects might need both. It is not really either/or any more.\nIt might make you a better programmer. In the Python world there is much more emphasis on quality code than in the R world.\nYou will possibly learn more about computer science through using Python.\nYou can easily mix R code with Python and get the best of both worlds – see e.g. the reticulate package.\nFor junior data scientists, having both Python and R skills increases employability across different sectors.\n\n\n\nI started off in base R, then changed to Python for a few years, then came back to R when the tidyverse and data.table were coming in – I have only used data.table since then. I suppose your other option if you are happy with your tidyverse level would be to learn data.table, the main advantage being that it runs so much faster than tidyverse, especially with larger data sets, and does more with less code, but if you don’t need speed or to work with large data sets then there is probably little to gain.\n\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Python/should-i-learn-python-now-i-know-r/","path":"/notes/Python/should-i-learn-python-now-i-know-r/","title":"Should I learn Python now I know R?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/R/":{"body":"R-related notes.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/R/","path":"/notes/R/","title":"R"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/R/deef-a-shiny-app/":{"body":"Nearly 10 years ago I was faced with the challenge of routinely collecting personally-identifiable data on TB cases from clinicians across my region. I created a form in Microsoft Word and some code (ultimately a Shiny app) to extract the data from a batch of forms (sent via secure email), which involved getting my head around XML and XPath queries. This process worked surprisingly well for several years, and I automated much of the analysis too. I even Dockerised the Shiny app at one point and tried to deploy it on our internal OpenShift platform (ultimately stymied by a non-functioning GitLab Runner). For fun (only) I deployed the app on my CapRover PaaS. It was my first real Shiny app and I did want to develop it further to tidy up the code and the user interface and capture more types of form field, but version 2 never progressed very far due to increasing competing demands on my time. Eventually the national surveillance data collection system was upgraded to capture the same data and we switched to using that instead.\nI had shared the app code with other interested teams in my organisation but only recently became aware that one of our national teams was still using it (in combination with Word macros), when someone did a stocktake of survey solutions we use. I was as surprised as I was gratified. It is likely to be replaced with a better process for us, but as it could still have applications where offline form-based data collection is the only option, I thought I would add it to the blog, as is.\nThe GitHub repo is here: Paul Cleary / deef · GitLab - you can run it from GitHub without cloning. The version I deployed to CapRover is here (it includes the Shiny code as a Git submodule): prcleary/caprover-deef: Shiny app. The rest of the information below is from the README file and the main code files.\nREADME\ndeef is a data extractor for electronic forms, compatible with Microsoft Word\nfiles with name ending .docx and/or .docm, i.e. compatible with Microsoft Office 2007 and later.\nIt is a work in progress.

You first need to make the Developer tab visible on the Ribbon as shown below, using Word Options:\n\nThen you can protect the document thus:\n\nYou don’t need to set a password (just leave the password fields blank and click Ok).\nFinally save the form.\nLimitation: Text Form Field data extracted may include other text in the same paragraph as the content control, so it is safest to use a table to structure your questionnaire and to put each content control in a separate cell, without any following text in the same cell.\nData can be copied to the clipboard or downloaded from the app as CSV or Microsoft Excel files.\nThe following packages must be installed:\n\ndata.table\nDT\nshiny\nXML\nxml2\n\nYou can install all dependencies with:\n\nYou can easily run the app on your own machine with a single command if you have R, RStudio and the above packages installed.\n\nYou can also use the extraction function in your own code - see https://gist.github.com/prcleary/c7f4dcbd9226c491ee53161ad7f88cef.\nYou can also run it in a Docker container - see enclosed Dockerfile.\nTODO\n\n\nRebuild based on Shiny modules to make it extensible\n\nUse a better-looking framework such as [shiny.fluent](https://appsilon.github.io/shiny.fluent/index.html\n\nMake the app available online via UKHSA OpenShift\n\nfixUploadedFilesNames.r\nThis was a hack which may no longer be necessary.

SENAITE (with the senaite.patient add-on) has an unsatisfactory solution to this: you can add arbitrary identifiers, but only if you go into the Patient listing and add the patient there, i.e. as an additional step to entering the sample request information. Ideally you would be able to enter the additional identifiers at the same time as you enter the sample request information.\nThe senaite.patient add-on adds patient handling to SENAITE. I forked the repo and created a branch from the last commit compatible with SENAITE 2.5.0. Then I created a new directory (src) in the buildout directory (/home/senaite/senaitelims) of my SENAITE installation and cloned the repo into that.\nI had to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (“repo” ticked only) to allow me to push from the VM to GitHub. As it happened I never made any changes to code on the VM.\nCode so far:\n\nI also cloned the repo, checked out the additional-fields branch and set the upstream branch on my local machine - this is where I tinkered with the code, pushing commits to GitHub and pulling them to the VM SENAITE installation.\nNext I had to configure the build process to use the repo, not the Python Package Index version of senaite.patient. In the buildout.cfg file, add senaite.patient under eggs = and src/senaite.patient under develop = not far below.\nI would like to say that I have a good understanding of Plone, which SENAITE is built on. I am starting to get more familiar with concepts such as adapters, subscribers, catalogs, brains etc. I have realised that the add-on machinery is very powerful. But mostly I grepped through the code looking for similar fields (grep -iRnw . -e 'MRN' can get you a long way) and used a copy/paste/adapt process. It did require some knowledge of Python classes. As a proof of concept I decided to add a “Test ID” field.\nAfter making some changes, I would push them to GitHub from my local machine and then do the following on the VM from the buildout directory, to pull the changes, rebuild the app and run the app again (there are ways to reload the app automatically in response to code changes, but I didn’t bother with those):\n\nAny errors in my code were quickly detected when I tried to run the app. After fixing errors, I logged into the Web app in my browser, created an instance (if I hadn’t done so previously) and looked to see if I had the desired functionality.\nAfter not that many iterations of this process (it was maybe a couple of days work), I had successfully added a “Test ID” field to a Patient, and made it appear in the sample request form. I had to edit more files than I expected - firstly to create the field and thereafter to make it appear in forms and listings, as well as doing other things such as setting permissions.\nYou can see the changes I made here thanks to GitHub’s cool “compare” functionality. At the time of writing I am up to the “Second attempt” commit. It seems to work, but needs more testing and I might need to make further changes.\nIn the process I spotted several other things I could tweak in senaite.patient (e.g. why three addresses?). I would still like to add a filter for “Department” to the samples listing view, though I could possibly manage without that. I might even look into making the additional identifiers searchable/indexable. I am still thinking of the best way to ensure that SENAITE data has matching geographies to DHIS 2, so I can import data into DHIS 2 and use it in analytics.\nThis all needs to be up and running by some time in October, so I am relieved this wasn’t more difficult. I do want to learn Plone properly at some point - I’ve even wondered whether to use it for my blog (dogfooding) but that’s very low on my priorities.\nEdit: in later debugging I learned that after any changes you need to uninstall and reinstall the app to check it all works.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/SENAITE/modifying-a-senaite-add-on/","path":"/notes/SENAITE/modifying-a-senaite-add-on/","title":"Modifying a SENAITE add-on"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/SENAITE/post-installation-checklist-for-senaite/":{"body":"Congratulations if you have successfully installed SENAITE. This checklist follows on here.\nTo save me retyping:\n\nBASE_URL refers to the base URL of your installation e.g. https://senaite.myorg.net\nSITE_URL refers to the SENAITE site you created e.g. https://senaite.myorg.net/senaite\n\n1. Consider installing additional useful tools for monitoring, security etc\n\n\nhtop gives you a prettier list of running processes, sortable by RAM/CPU usage etc\nneofetch displays information about your system (in future I think fastfetch may replace this)\ntmux allows you to split your terminal into multiple screens, which is useful for monitoring several things at once\nlynis gives you server hardening suggestions if you run lynis audit system as root\n\n2. Secure your system, e.g. SSH, firewall, other things suggested from the Lynis system audit or in GitHub - imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server: An evolving how-to guide for securing a Linux server.\nIf you used the default admin password (admin) when building the app then you need to change it. According to the buildout file, you shouldn’t be able to change it there:\n\nYou should be able to change your password here: SITE_URL/password_form but I got an error the first time I tried this, and was still able to log in with the old password. But after a few attempts, changing it both ways, I managed to change the admin password. You can find the admin password in the adminPassword.txt file in the buildout folder.\n3. Configure the system so that SENAITE restarts after the system has rebooted, as per here.\n4. Expose SENAITE to the Internet with an HTTPS URL.\nI manage DNS through Cloudflare - for my demo installations I have been creating a subdomain and pointing it to the Nginx Proxy Manager LXC container running on Proxmox. Creating a “Proxy Host” on NPM allows me to obtain an SSL certificate and add security headers - more on that here. There is more on Plone security in general here: Plone Security Best Practices — Plone Documentation v5.2\n5. If you set up monitoring, you can use the following endpoints:\n\nBASE_URL/@@ok\nBASE_URL/ZopeTime\n\nI often use UptimeRobot: Free Website Monitoring Service, though I am thinking of switching to self-hosted Uptime Kuma.\nYou could also install something like Netdata for monitoring resource utilisation: Monitor your entire infrastructure in high-resolution and in real-time..\n6. If required, add a rewrite rule to enable you to import setup data from a spreadsheet.\nBecause I was using an Nginx proxy, I had to add a rewrite rule to the config to get this to work (in NPM, Edit Proxy Host –&gt; Advanced –&gt; Custom Nginx Configuration).\n\nI had an issue where SENAITE crashed trying to print invoices, which might have been due to this rule preventing SENAITE from finding things like fonts, so you probably want to remove this after any setup data is loaded.\n7. Enable any SENAITE add-ons you are using at SITE_URL/prefs_install_products_form - click “Install” for each.\nIf you’ve forked and tweaked the add-ons then you need to do this each time after you have rebuilt the app.\n8. Customise/brand the appearance of your app\nSENAITE doesn’t offer different themes or allow you to easily re-skin the app with CSS, but you can add a logo and favicon and change the site title.\nSITE_URL/setup (Appearance tab) allows you to upload a logo and resize it with CSS (e.g. height: 45px;).\nIn other setup tabs you will find options such as:\n\nAllow the user to directly enter results after sample creation, e.g. to enter field results immediately, or lab results, when the automatic sample reception is activated.\nGroup analyses by category for samples\nAnalyses are required for sample registration\nSet the email body text to be used by default when sending out result reports to the selected recipients. You can use reserved keywords: $client_name, $recipients, $lab_name, $lab_address\n\nYou may also be able to change the logo at SITE_URL/@@site-controlpanel, though this didn’t seem to work for me. This is where you can change the site title.\nYou can generate a favicon from your logo: Favicon Generator - Image to Favicon - favicon.io. Then follow the Bika LIMS instructions to add it: LIMS browser Title and favicon. Banner colour — LIMS Collective, which are:\n\nReplace the existing logo at SITE_URL/portal_skins/senaite_images/favicon.ico/manage_main (I am assuming your new favicon is also called favicon.ico)\nThen change the TAL at SITE_URL/portal_view_customizations/zope.interface.interface-plone.links.favicon/manage_main (compare your URL - it is easy to end up in the wrong place changing the wrong thing) to:\n\n\n\nThe site favicon may not change immediately - I haven’t yet worked out if it is clearing the browser cache or restarting/rebuilding the app that makes it appear.\n\nYou can select a default view at SITE_URL/select_default_view - I have been making the Samples view the default under “Choose a content item”. Clicking on the logo will then always take you back to the main samples listing view.\nYou can hide the SENAITE footer at SITE_URL/@@manage-viewlets under ViewletManager: plone.portalfooter (plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IPortalFooter) --&gt; Viewlet: plone.footer - click “Hide”.\nI did find a way of altering what appears in the left panel (Clients, Batches, Worksheets, Methods, Patients by default) but for the life of me I can’t remember what I did - probably something in SITE_URL/@@navigation-controlpanel.\n9. Configure SENAITE settings to your liking at SITE_URL/@@overview-controlpanel.\nI have been tending to turn off anything that would be unnecessarily restrictive for a small non-accredited lab without many staff.\nOptions here include:\n\nDate and time related settings like timezone(s), etc\nEmail settings: you can use internal or external services\nSecurity settings\nConfiguration Registry and Zope Management Interface (ZMI): experts only!\nImpress settings: print settings and lab report templates\nPatient settings (if you are using the senaite.patient add-on), including:\n\nRequire Medical Record Number (MRN)\nAllow to verify samples with a temporary MRN\nAllow to publish samples with a temporary MRN\nDisplay an alert icon on samples with a temporary MRN\nAge, gender, address, marital status, race and ethnicity data entry options\nConfiguring additional patient identifiers\nShare patient on sample creation\nAllow patients in clients\n\n\nSENAITE Registry: haven’t found I needed to change much/anything here - not clear what the “Sample Header” bit is about.\n\n10. Configure other settings to your liking at SITE_URL/bika_setup.\nOptions here include:\n\nAutomatic log-off: The number of minutes before a user is automatically logged off.\nAllow access to worksheets only to assigned analysts\nAllow to submit results for unassigned analyses or for analyses assigned to others\nOnly lab managers can create and manage worksheets\nCurrency, country, member discount and VAT rate\nGroup analysis services by category in the LIMS tables - helpful when the list is long\nGroup analyses by category for samples\nRequire sample analyses for sample registration\nImmediate results entry\nAdd a remarks field to all analyses\nAutomatic verification of samples when all results are verified\nAllow self-verification of results\nDefault count of Samples to add\nDefault layout/landing page\nEnable the Results Report Printing workflow\nAuto-receive samples when recreated\nTurnaround times\nEmail body text and default recipients\nStandard formats for identifiers e.g. for Patients/Medical Record Numbers\n\n11. Modify certain user-facing listings/forms.\n\nSITE_URL/samples: click the three dots (main panel, top left) to show/hide/reorder columns.\nSITE_URL/patients: ditto\nYou can also show/hide/reorder fields in analysis requests, but you can only do this after you are able to add an analysis request - there is a “Manage Form Fields” link for users with appropriate permissions.\n\n12. Create or import metadata\nYou can manually add users, tests etc but there is a particular sequence you should follow:\n\nFinish the steps above\nYou can enter laboratory and accreditation information at SITE_URL/bika_setup/laboratory.\nMost of the following is done via SITE_URL/@@lims-setup and choosing from the buttons.\nCreate Lab Contacts (the LIMS users, specifying their roles, login details etc) and Laboratory Departments - read this as the current quickstart documentation didn’t work for me.\n\nNote that the Lab Manager role has the most permissions after the admin role; you will probably also need the Analyst and Lab Clerk roles; roles seem to determine more what you can do than what you can see (Worksheets are for controlling what analysts can see)\n\n\nAdd Laboratory Departments e.g. Haematology, Serology\nAdd Clients (the organisations sending samples to the lab, e.g. GPs, clinics, hospital wards) and Client Contacts (the individuals from those organisations that are communicated with)\nAdd Container Types, Containers and Preservations (optional)\n\nContainer Types (categories of container e.g. blood collection)\nContainers (specific types e.g. Blood Collection Tube (EDTA))\nPreservations (types of sample preservation, e.g. viral transport medium)\n\n\nAdd the metadata for individual samples/tests:\n\nSample Matrices (categories of sample type - in a human health context it would be e.g. blood, urine, tissue)\nSample Types (e.g. whole blood, serum, plasma, bone marrow aspirate)\nSample Points (location of sampling - I have used this to capture a standardised geography attribute that I can use for analysis or integration with DHIS 2; it is a small tweak to /home/senaite/buildout-cache/eggs/cp27mu/senaite.core-2.5.0-py2.7.egg/bika/lims/content/analysisrequest.py to make this field mandatory)\n\nIf required, add Manufacturers and Suppliers of lab instruments\n\n\n\n\nOnce the above is done, add Methods (aka Analysis Methods): for example, if a particular test could be done in different ways (e.g. a blood count could be done by manual or automated processes) then these can be specified separately for the same test - if you don’t need this level of detail then just create one method called something like “Default method” as it will be shown in lab reports and will be needed later to avoid “No Method selected for this Service” errors.\nIf required, add Instruments and other instrument-related information\nAdd Analysis Categories and Analysis Services: Analysis Services just means tests e.g. Alanine aminotransferase, and Analysis Categories means category of tests e.g. “Liver function tests” and is used for grouping results in reports\n\nyou should associate each Analysis Service with an Analysis Category, a unique keyword (which you should not change later), a Method, a Laboratory Department, plus optionally specifying other things like price, unit and turnaround time.\n\nyou also add Result Options for each test, e.g. the VDLR test can have “reactive” or “non-reactive” results.\n\n\n\n\nYou can add (Results) Calculations, which allow you to use a bit of Python to derive a numeric result from one or more other numeric results.\nAnalysis Specifications are where you enter reference range data; you can have e.g. different ones for males and females (these can be selected at sample registration)\nAnalysis Profiles: this is where you specify panels of tests that are commonly done together and have one price, e.g. liver function tests.\nAnalysis Request (AR) Templates are a convenient way to allow selection of prespecified tests/panels at sample registration; they can contain one or more Analysis Profiles and specify the sample type.\nThere are lots of other things you can add (and I haven’t even gone into the requirements for add-ons like senaite.ast) but the above ones are most important for an initial set up.\n\nThere is a way of importing metadata from a spreadsheet, which doesn’t seem to be recommended but which does still work to some extent. A template is provided here: Bika and Senaite Setup data upload Template 1.9 - Google Sheets. This is set up with some internal dropdowns to help enter data in a consistent way. Note that any column with a yellow star is a required field. It is quite a complicated beast and at some point I hope to share a functioning more developed demo version that fixes existing issues. Here is my attempt at visually understanding the relationships between the many tabs. I only got this to work with relatively simple uploads and ended up entering most of the metadata manually.\nThere is a “Rubik’s Cube” symbol on the right of the header bar; click the arrow to the right of it and select “Import”, which takes you to a page with options to import either demo metadata or your own metadata.\nComplete a copy of the online spreadsheet with your own information, deleting any demo information that is there. Download it as an Excel file (*.xlsx) and then (important) delete all rows below the rows containing your information (they contain formatting which borks the import to SENAITE). This takes time - for each tab, highlight the first blank row, use the Ctrl-Shift-Down keyboard combo and then right-click and select Delete.\nIt is best to test the metadata import on a demo version of SENAITE before applying it to your production instance. You can run SENAITE in foreground mode while doing this (bin/instance fg) to see the server logs, or use something like tail -f var/log/*. If it doesn’t work you will need to know what errors are appearing in the logs.\n\nIf you get a Python AuthenticationError then there may be a problem with your proxy server - see the rewrite rule tip above.\nIf you get an IndexError then there is an issue with the spreadsheet.\nIf you get a “not implemented” error then check the spreadsheet you are trying to upload is not open.\n\nOnce you get through the import without showstopper errors, you will see that not all the information in the spreadsheet has been imported, most noticeably:\n\nClient Contacts do not import, seemingly because the format of that tab is wrong (edit: I think it is actually just hidden, so you will need to unhide it in the spreadsheet) - at some point I will try to fix this in the spreadsheet. The import code is here: senaite.core/src/senaite/core/exportimport/setupdata/init.py at 2.x · senaite/senaite.core · GitHub\nLab Departments do not import with their Managers\nLab Contacts don’t import with their Lab Departments\n\nAll of the above can be fixed manually afterwards in the Web interface. There are also some things that you can’t do with the import spreadsheet, such as determining whether one or multiple results can be recorded for a particular test - e.g. for blood film they might want to record a number of things such as pencil cells or spherocytes, but these can be done manually.\nNote that this is not an “idempotent” process; if you import the spreadsheet twice during testing you will see that most of the information now appears twice in the system. Advice on getting rid of previously imported information is here.\nAs a final word, for all the above, the Bika LIMS User Manual can be very helpful where SENAITE documentation is lacking: User Manual — LIMS Collective. Bika LIMS is a predecessor system to SENAITE that still seems to be used in some places.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/SENAITE/post-installation-checklist-for-senaite/","path":"/notes/SENAITE/post-installation-checklist-for-senaite/","title":"Post-installation checklist for SENAITE"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/SENAITE/senaite-customising-laboratory-report-content/":{"body":"senaite/senaite.patient: Patient handling for SENAITE is the add-on that adds the capability to SENAITE to manage patient data but unfortunately it does not include any patient information in lab reports (COA, or Certificates Of Analysis in SENAITE parlance) by default. The COA templates used are in the folder /home/senaite/buildout-cache/eggs/cp27mu/senaite.impress-2.5.0-py2.7.egg/senaite/impress/templates/reports/ - you can create a Plone add-on which overrides these templates (hard if you don’t know Plone) or simply edit the templates in place (easier but your changes will disappear if you upgrade senaite.patient). Plone is pretty complex and it may be a while before I am creating my own add-ons, so I went with the easy option.\nThe COA templates are written in something called TALES, or Template Attribute Language. This consists of HTML elements (which do not change) and XML elements (which reflect the dynamic parts) - it is a bit like RMarkdown, where the Markdown does not change but the R code chunks are converted to something else when the document is created. Here Python does the converting - you can even reference Python functions or use Python code. Beyond that I don’t claim to understand TALES much yet, but with a little bit of HTML knowledge and the help of the convenient SENAITE SuperModel I was able to create my own COA template from one of the existing ones (MultiDefault.pt) to include the lab and patient information I wanted, as well as the logo of the lab.\n\nIncluding &lt;tal:report define=\"model python:view.model;\"&gt; at the start indicates that I want to use the SENAITE SuperModel - this is a “content wrapper” which allows you to reference data through a unified interface.\nYou can see this in use with &lt;a tal:content=\"model/getPatientFullName\"/&gt; - I found the names of the elements by rooting through the source code (there is probably a better way).\nWith a bit of trial and error and fiddling with the CSS I changed the header of the report, as in the section beginning NEW REPORT HEADER. I had already uploaded the logo image file using the instructions here: 1.4.1 Replace the LIMS logo, banner, title and favicon — LIMS Collective\nThe section beginning NEW PATIENT INFO is the main other bit I added, showing patient information in a tabular format. To format Age I used a bit of Python code; to format Sex I used a bit of TALES logic.\n\nThe result looks good.

It runs on a cloud VM (one of Hetzner’s cheapest tier offerings) and automatically makes backups of the emails locally. I’ve been using rsync to keep an up-to-date copy of the backups on my desktop machine. The alias in my .bashrc that I use is (sensitive details obscured):\n\nI have another alias which runs several other aliases for various system administration tasks such as updates and backups. I run this daily from my home Linux box, or via my phone if I am away.\nWhen I got my new home server I decided to try out Nextcloud All-In-One and this comes with a backup process based on BorgBase - Simple and Secure Offsite Backups. As I now had an account with them, I decided to back up my football emails there too. You get a terabyte for about $24 a year so it’s probably cheaper than doing it yourself.\nIt is not that complicated at the end of the day, but I did make some mistakes in the process, for example starting with the comprehensive documentation on the borgmatic site and getting diverted into some similar instructions on the BorgBase site. The instructions below are mostly taken from the borgmatic site, which it is best to adhere to. I also had some problems with SSH, which seemed to work in some ways but not in others. After several rounds with asking for help from DeepSeek and searching the Web, I eventually solved the problem myself by realising something quite simple, which I mention below.\nI’m glad I worked it out, because this could be useful for all sorts of server backups.\nInstructions\nInstall the software and check it can be run: this installs it so you can run it as root or as an ordinary user - I might want to do either.\nNote that after some steps you should exit your shell and open another. I also had to add a local executable path into the sudo configuration for this to work.\n\nIf you don’t already have SSH keys then you should create them. If you want to run borgmatic both as root and as an ordinary user, you should make sure that the SSH keys are in both ~/.ssh and /root/.ssh, and that permissions and ownership are correct.\nThen you will need to copy the public key you want to use to borgbase.com.\n\nPaste the output to the SSH keys section on borgbase.com and save it there.\nAgain on the borgbase.com site, create a new repository, specifying:\n\nname of repo\nstorage in EU\ntype: Borg\nselect key (append-only access - stops an intruder from permanently deleting your backups)\nalerting if no backup after 1 day\nenable compaction\nfinally add the repo\n\nYou should then get a URL for the remote repo, in the format: ssh://xxxxxxxx@xxxxxxxx.repo.borgbase.com/./repo\nI wanted to create a local backup as well, so I created a folder for that outside my home directory:\n\nNext you want to create a template configuration file for borgmatic:\n\nYou can edit the configuration file you just created with:\n\nMy configuration file looks like this (there are lots of other options I haven’t explored):\n\nWhat this does is (in a single configuration file - cool):\n\nSpecify multiple files or folders for backup\nSpecify where the backups are to go\nRetention periods for backups\nChecks to be done on the backups\nThe passphrase I want to use for encryption\n\nIt is easy to end up with invalid YAML in your configuration file, so make sure to check it with:\n\nNext you need to “initiate” your repositories:\n\nThen you should obtain the Borg encryption keys, which are different to your SSH key and different for each location you are backing up to (you will need these and the passphrase for recovery):\n\nSave each key shown, which each looks like this:\n\nNow your repositories are set up, you can do a test backup:\n\nIf that works without errors (I had to go back and try to fix SSH several times, before realising that both my user and root needed the keys), you can now run a backup:\n\nThis may take a while if it is a big backup.\nThe command which you will then run routinely is the following, which does the backup as well as other routine maintenance:\n\nYou can run the backup manually whenever you like, or (better) create a CRON job to run the backup/maintenance at 3am each day, in which case you need to create a file containing this line, with the commands below:\n\n\nCheck the CRON command can run with:\n\nYou now have a 3-2-1 backup strategy, with various checks.\nIf you lose a file, you can search for versions of it in your backups with:\n\nI haven’t tried this yet, but borgmatic has extract and restore commands for restoring from backups - I intend to try these out, as a resilient backup strategy should also check that the backups can be restored.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Selfhosting/backing-up-servers-and-desktops-with-borgmatic/","path":"/notes/Selfhosting/backing-up-servers-and-desktops-with-borgmatic/","title":"Backing up servers and desktops with borgmatic"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Selfhosting/how-to-install-peertube-on-ubuntu/":{"body":"PeerTube is a self-hosted video streaming platform, with various social networking features that I am not using.

Look out for the web login details in the Docker output.\nI then pointed a Cloudflare Tunnel at http://&lt;IP address&gt;:9000 - job done.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Selfhosting/how-to-install-peertube-on-ubuntu/","path":"/notes/Selfhosting/how-to-install-peertube-on-ubuntu/","title":"How to install PeerTube on Ubuntu"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Selfhosting/notes-on-new-homelab-setup/":{"body":"Bullet point notes on recent acquisition of home server and set up so far:\n\n\nAim was to consolidate my various servers and perhaps save some money\n\n\nI had a (somewhat underused) dedicated Hetzner auction server running mostly dispensable health information system and other experiments, plus a large VM for paperless-ngx, the super-useful tool for managing your PDFs.\n\n\nI also had a few cloud VMs with Hetzner; the main one ran CapRover as a Platform-as-a-Service for Nextcloud, my wife’s blog, several other Docker containers and my various app experiments. CapRover is great and served me well for a long time, but I feel I’ve outgrown it a bit. The other two VMs run Mail-in-a-Box as the mail server for a local sports club and RustDesk to enable me to remotely fix my mum’s laptop - I don’t plan to touch those at the moment.\n\n\nI treated myself to a Minisforum MS-01 (Intel® Core™ i9-12900H / 32GB RAM+1TB SSD / UK) just before Xmas.\n\n\nMy plan was to install Proxmox as a virtualisation environment and then deploy virtual machines/containers to provide my various online services. I use Nextcloud for tasks/notes/miscellaneous files, Calibre-Web-Automated for ebooks and Paperless NGX for my large collection of PDFs. I wanted at least those services to be in separate VMs/containers for greater flexibility. I also wanted to have the flexibility of CapRover (though not necessarily CapRover) for running various services that don’t really deserve their own VM/container as well as my own web apps. I also wanted the option to play with Kubernetes a bit if possible.\n\n\nI downloaded Proxmox 8.3.1 and flashed the OS image to a USB drive with balenaEtcher.\n\n\nAfter fiddling with the boot options on the server I installed Proxmox onto the server and configured the network (static IP address and gateway). I connected the server to the home router and then hid it, as I could do everything else via the LAN. Didn’t bother with RAID or any fancy file systems, though I might come back to this.\n\n\nRan the Proxmox Post Install script from Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts, copied over my SSH keys (ssh-copy-id) and set the locale.\n\n\nSet up BassT23/Proxmox: Update your Proxmox VE to help with updates.\n\n\nApart from multifactor authentication, I haven’t done much else to secure the server or configure remote backups yet, but I will come back to that. I might use a separate VLAN and set up Google Drive for backups.\n\n\nI experimented with the Nextcloud options from Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts but eventually decided to go for nextcloud/all-in-one: 📦 The official Nextcloud installation method. Provides easy deployment and maintenance with most features included in this one Nextcloud instance..\n\n\nI initially experimented with Tailscale for secure access, but as I needed to be able to access things from my work computer I decided it was simpler to go with Cloudflare Tunnels. Not all features of Nextcloud All-In-One will work behind a Cloudflare Tunnel apparently, but I haven’t had any issues with the features I need.\n\n\nI installed an Ubuntu 24.04 VM for Nextcloud, and used this to set up Cloud-Init, resize the disk (after I had allocated it more space) and install other things including Docker and Docker Compose.\n\n\nI initially started Nextcloud with the docker run command given, but then decided to use Docker Compose instead (after cleaning up images, containers, volumes etc first), using this from (Solved)AIO working with Cloudflare? · nextcloud/all-in-one · Discussion #2845:\n\n\n\nAfter docker compose up -d, it soon shows a /setup page where you get a passphrase to log in to the system. After that you go to a /containers page where you can select which additional options you want (I chose most of them).\n\n\nThen you wait while it sets up. It then gives you an initial admin password which you should change. Nextcloud was then accessible on my local network.\n\n\nI configured my profile and set up email via the football club mailserver. I then installed all the Nextcloud apps I have used previously, plus some exciting new ones. I even got Nextcloud Office to work! However the Tables app still seems a bit flaky. I used the “OCCWeb” app to run commands like maintenance:repair to check/fix things. I also tweaked the config file for my phone region - I still have no idea why this can’t be done in the GUI.\n\n\nI logged into Cloudflare and created a tunnel - it is ridiculously easy. Name your tunnel, copy the code provided into the VM console, specify the port and you’re done. I could now access my Nextcloud login page on the public Internet.\n\n\nI use the nextcloud/desktop: 💻 Desktop sync client for Nextcloud to synchronise files to my desktop machine, so I paused that, removed the connection and then connected it to the new Nextcloud instance.\n\n\nI use Tasks.org Android mobile app to synchronise my tasks with Nextcloud. On the mobile app, I moved all my tasks into local lists, connected it to the new Nextcloud instance and then moved my tasks back into their original lists.\n\n\nI also use Nextcloud as backup/sync location for various mobile apps such as Moon+ Reader for Android ebook reader (which I use a lot) and XilinJia/Podcini: Open source podcast instrument for Android supporting contents from YouTube and YT Music as well as normal podcasts., so reconfigured those.\n\n\nNext I installed an Ubuntu 24.04 VM (from a template) and installed Ghost: The best open source blog &amp; newsletter platform from scratch for my wife’s blog, which has only one post so I just copied and pasted it over.\n\n\nI backed up all my VMs/containers on my old Proxmox and scp’d them to the new server, which took ages. Restoring them taught me a few things.\n\n\nFirstly, I think I only had storage called local on my old Proxmox, whereas my new one has both local and local-lvm. I should have restored things to the flexible storage local-lvm not the root file system local, as local soon filled up. Proxmox did tried to warn me but I changed the settings of local to allow container directories. But once I realised what I was doing I backed them up and restored them in the right location.\n\nRestoring VMs: e.g. qmrestore /var/lib/vz/dump/vzdump-qemu-100-2025_02_16-13_59_09.vma.zst 100 --storage local-lvm\nRestoring LXC containers: e.g. pct restore 103 /var/lib/vz/dump/vzdump-lxc-104-2025_02_16-13_55_14.tar.zst --storage local-lvm\n\n\n\nSecondly you have to reconfigure network settings for each VM/container. For LXC containers this is done on the host (any changes to /etc/network/interfaces in the container will be overwritten at reboot), e.g. vim /etc/pve/lxc/103.conf. For Ubuntu VMs you configure network settings in the VM with e.g. sudo vim /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml. Restart after any changes.\n\n\nI was able to restore all of my backups on the new server.\n\n\nAfter restoring my Paperless NGX LXC, I added the new public URL to the config file and created a Cloudflare Tunnel. I also reconfigured the mobile app and set up integration with Nextcloud - now I can send files from my phone camera or from Nextcloud.\n\n\nFor my ebooks I then set up a Docker VM with Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts. I increased the disk size and then grew the file system in the VM using growpart and resize2fs. I created the folders required for volumes, amended the Docker Compose script for Calibre Web Automated, docker compose up -d’d it up, scp’d my ebooks into the ingest folder, checked the settings and made it accessible with a Cloudflare Tunnel.\n\n\nI cancelled the Hetzner server as I had no further need for it. I still have a few things running behind CapRover but I will get to those soon.\n\n\nI then set up an LXC container with Vikunja: The open-source, self-hostable to-do app as it’s something I’ve been interested in playing with for task management. I’m not convinced it is worth moving from Nextcloud Tasks at this point.\n\n\nCapRover isn’t intended to be run behind a Cloudflare Tunnel, though I think you can do it. So I decided to try out CasaOS - A simple, easy-to-use, elegant open-source personal cloud system to give me at least some of the flexibility of CapRover for trying out apps or arbitrary Docker containers. There is a handy script to automate most installation (as an LXC) here: Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts. CasaOS looks very nice and has a small but useful app store. I’ve set up the Cloudflared app as per here: How to use Cloudflare Tunnel in CasaOS? - CasaOS / CasaOS - Tutorials - IceWhale Community Forum. This is where I am up to, installing various apps and seeing what I can do with this.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Selfhosting/notes-on-new-homelab-setup/","path":"/notes/Selfhosting/notes-on-new-homelab-setup/","title":"Notes on new homelab setup"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Statistics/":{"body":"Statistics-related notes.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Statistics/","path":"/notes/Statistics/","title":"Statistics"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/Statistics/notes-on-using-bayesian-statistics-in-outbreak-investigation/":{"body":"\nrecently had the opportunity to try out Bayesian methods in a large gastrointestinal disease outbreak\ncase-case study, comparing cases of outbreak infection with cases of another gastrointestinal infection\ndata collected from different regions/countries, in different ways\n\nno sampling;
